Pyminlib contains the resources I made for the game.<br>&emsp;imagetobytes.py is something to convert an image to a string of bytes so I could contain them in the main script instead of having files along with it.<br>&emsp;html_parser.py is a modified version of the html parser from [tkhtmlview](https://github.com/bauripalash/tkhtmlview/) which is used for the game's wiki to make page links work. I implemented it so that the user must give a function separate from the html by defining "callobject" in the html_parser at runtime, then using unicode character FFFF at the beginning of the href to denote that it is a command and not a link, with extra FFFF characters being used to separate the function arguements. You can pipe this to exec which is why you should not use this outside of this project.<br>&emsp;as3toplevel.py has been moved to [as3lib](https://github.com/ajdelguidice/python-as3lib), a python library specifically so the I can implement the things needed by this game.

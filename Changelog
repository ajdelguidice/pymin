Changed str variable to _str_ because it conflicts with a built in function
Rearranged some statements to make more sense
Converted variables before displaying them to the screen because "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str"
Changed "\r" to "\n" becuase python uses universal backslash expressions instead of adobe's bullshit
Replaced "||" with or and "&&" with "and"
Removed "this." becuase it isn't needed
Commented out unused parts of the origional code instead of removing them
Interface rewritten in tkinter becuase it looked the most similar to the origional
Removed backslashes before single quotes where they weren't necessary because python knows how to handle single quotes within double quotes and can tell the difference between the two
Global statements everywhere because python is a local default language

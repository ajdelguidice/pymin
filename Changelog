Changed str variable to _str_ because it conflicts with a built in function
Rearranged some statements to make more sense
Converted variables before displaying them to the screen because "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str"
Changed "\r" to "\n" becuase python uses universal backslash expressions instead of adobe's bullshit
Replaced "||" with or and "&&" with "and"
Removed "this." becuase it isn't needed
Commented out unused parts of the origional code instead of removing them
Interface rewritten in tkinter becuase it looked the most similar to the origional
Removed backslashes before single quotes where they weren't necessary because python knows how to handle single quotes within double quotes and can tell the difference between the two
Global statements everywhere because python is a local default language
Pointed functions to the correct place in python (ex: in flash it's Math.random() but in python it's random.random())
Save data and preferences are now stored in xml format instead of shared objects because I couldn't find any libraries for action messaging format that still worked. If I get arround to it, I might make my own library or at least make a way to convert old save files to new ones but that is a lot of work and amf is very confusing
Remade images 1 and 2 to be centered

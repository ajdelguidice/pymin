v1.0.10
Set the initial directory of the load/save file dialogs to the save folder
Fixed a bug on Windows introduced in 1.0.9 that made a folder named Pyminnimin_saves get created in ../ relative to the game or venv_root (it would switch between the two) when nimin_saves was not found
[original game] Fixed double button press after using items 204 and 205
Refactored skinDesc
Fixed the text display in one of the sandwich sinarios in doDesert
Overhauled the save file converter. It can now convert from any supported format to any supported format. Supported formats include xml, sol, and nim.
Added "recreate" function to the venv script. THIS DELETES ALL DATA IN THE VIRUAL ENVIRONMENT and then creates an new one,
Removed the redundant "plush and snuggly" from appearance when grammar tweaks is active.
Added special game tweaks that only show up and work when in debug mode.
Added alwaysChooseSenario to debug tweaks
Corrected the grammar of error messages and made their formatting consistent.
Save location changes in the options window actually change the save location now.
Added the ability to save to and load from any supported save format when using the "Save as"/"Load File" buttons.
Changed the save dialog to reflect current conditions.
Fixed a bug I introduced in relation to eggTime (When changing operators over to python, I accidentally made "--" into "+= 1" instead of "-= 1"). You should now be able to lay eggs.
Added a check to doLoad that puts eggTime back down to a normal value if any version of this port before this one was used. This is so you don't have to wait for it to count down from the absurd value it was at due to the what is mentioned in the previous change.
Added a message to Jamie's senario in doFirmshaft explaining that there is no more content. This only appears if his rep value is above 10.
Hotkeys are now ignored when the saveInvalidDialog is open
Removed all calls to as3lib.toplevel.listtoarray because it isn't needed.
Places where max was used are now changed to as3lib.toplevel.Math.max. The add 0 hack has also been removed from the max functions.
Sped up doWeight slightly by reducing the number of division done (addition, subtraction, and multiplication are almost free on modern cpus, division is not).
Added more comments to functions
Added the option "noclear" to the status update functions to allow the up/down images to stay from the previous call
Simplified calculations in doRace (instead of doing "+= -#" it now does "-= #")
Bag/Stash buttons no longer flicker when pressing on an empty slot, when selling items, or when clicking on an item that can not be used
Added lizanDontShowBalls to the game tweaks menu. While lizanDontShowBalls is active, changing cock type now changes the value of self.showBalls depending on what type of cocks you have
Neuterizer now has a variable to tell the game when it was used to make showBalls False. This is ignored when lizanDontShowBalls is False.
Fixed a mistake in the shops that caused the game to crash when you don't have enough coins to buy something
Fixed a save file version check that would fail and cause the game to not load
[original game] Fixed an issue that caused the return button to not work while holding shift in the general shop's sell dialog
Created listFilesInDir function
Created bsRefresh function to refresh the bag/stash instead of redrawing the entire thing. This heavily reduces the flickering of the amount values.
Added an expanded save/load file screen that shows all files inside of the save directory. It can be toggled in the game tweaks menu. This is not enabled by default.
Replaced self.doSexP(0) and self.dayTime(0) with the display command as that is what it looks like they were intended to do. self.dayTime(0) causes goGeneral to be called even though it shouldn't which was one of the reasons why loading the game was so slow.
Debug items "Teleport Scroll: Any" and "Debug Stick" are now fully functional
Debug window now saves it's scroll position after refreshing. It does some weird stuff near the bottom but that is because the scrollable region is very large.
Added a way to change the sort order of the new save/load dialog
Made discard button change color with the rest of the scene.
Added numpad keybindings for most of the features I added to the main window.
Fixed a grammar mistake in the gametweaks menu
Wiki window now starts with the first item selected. You shouldn't need to move the cursor to prevent errors anymore
Wiki keybindings have been changed to make more sense
Added both wasd and numpad navigation to the wiki
Made the enter key always work in the wiki
Wiki menu options are now added all at once instead of one at a time
Page links in the wiki now work properly. This does require a custom html parser for tkhtmlview which is included in this repo.
Updated the venv setup script to automatically install my custom html parser for tkhtmlview
Fixed a bug in the normal save dialog that caused sol files to not show up unless solonlymode was enabled
Remove typing.Union import and replace Unions with "x | y" syntax. This project requires python 3.10 anyways so why not use it.
Gave the game window and the about window a proper title.
Added some stuff to the intro screen.
Added the option to use uv instead of pip in the venv script.
venvscript now prints the help message when there aren't enough arguements.
Made succubusLeavesOne always work when enabled.
Started adding links into the wiki.
Fixed quit from menu bar
Added takeNoDamage to debug tweaks
Made use of isBottomOpen in places that need it but only if it is toggled on in the game tweaks menu.
Removed unnecessary imports from nim file testing
Made imports look better
Added a new save item to the SOL save files called versionNumberPymin. Anything not explicitly defined is ignored by the original game so this should be fine
Fixed item 522 and 531.
Made most of the rest of the _Desc functions return the result directly
Fixed the error handling in the _Desc functions
Used self.percent directly in the _Desc functions. It is only used once so it should not be assigned to a variable.
Changed the window icon (taskbar icon on some linux window managers) to one closely resembling flash player's icon (I created it based off of the images that I have of the icon)
(Implementation incomplete) Added a game tweak to make herms able to experience both male and female gendered senarios where it makes sense to.
Explore senarios in Oviasis are now affected by lizanDontShowBalls
Compressed a check in cockChange, it was a long chain of if statements, now it's "if self.dominant in (...)"
Directly return value in itemName, usableItem, conItem
Fixed unused function clearEmptySlots
Rearranged checkEmptySlots to do less work and directly return the output.
Used the warnings.deprecated decorator for functions that were replaced instead of commenting them out.
Rearranged hairstyleID, pullUD, tailDesc to only need one "else" case
Made hairstyleLength use "if ID in (...)" instead of match-case
Fixed error cases in many functions
Implemented textCheck in outputMainText
Added a variable to disable hotkeys when keyboard is used for typing
Added comments to the hotkeys function to tell what each keycode is
Added a variable for when alt is held. This is used to override the keyboard being disabled
All hotkeys are now disabled when using the new save/load dialog. To override this, press alt while hitting the key
Added comments to cockChange, vagChange
Added missing self. in affinityChange
Made affinityChange and doProcess use the Array.sort function from as3lib because sort(16) is now implemented
Fixed OWLoadVars
Made item 108 display a bar when affinity is 1 and made it display the same number of bars as the original game. Both issues were caused by python's range function not including the second number (range(0,2)->[0,1])
Made checkValidHex, isValidDirectory, checkExistsMakeDir checkExtension, resolveDir, listFilesInDir, inv, boolToState, percent, getdh, getdhSOL, getdhNIM, itemName, usableItem, conItem, itemValue, itemStackMax, foodItem, dyeID, hairstyleLength, hairstyleVale, hairstyleDescription, clothesName, clothesValue, clothesDescription, specialAbilityName, specialAbilityDescription, solString, solGetFileName, toXMLReturn, and toXMLReturnNIM staticmethods because they don't need the self parameter
Added "if __name__ == '__main__'" check
Moved a check for python path stupidity out of the checkExistsMakeDir function to where it should be
Refactored checkExistsMakeDir
Fixed a problem in cockChange that I introduced while porting that only seemed to affect the stuff that I added on in this release so I didn't catch it until now
Put the calculations for showButtons, showButtonsBag, viewAmount, and showSidePanel into separate functions so @cache could be used to speed things up. This has nothing to do with "clean" code.
Removed some of the unnecessary calculations done for the interface. These were there because I was lazy during development but aren't needed.
Fixed a bug in moveToBag that made it possible to move items into the arrow and return buttons.
Added gametweak DirectPathToSanctuary
Used any() instead of the "!= 0" check in doProcess because it effectively does the same thing.
Added the missing race affinities to the "!= 0" check in doProcess
Fixed apothID returning None when you already have a recipe
Fixed a couple of function returns when no condition is met
Fixed an issue with doSubmit enemy 202, 304
Fixed an issue with doRape enemy 301, 302, 303
Combined the options window and gametweaks window into one and used ttk.notebook to organise things
Fixed options window variable checking and added error messages
Made checkValidHex faster
Added None check to gametweaksCheckIfAllIsValue because "not None" == True for some reason
Made checkExistsMakeDir use one pathlib.Path object for everything
Condensed multiple if statements into one and removed the redundant sort in listFilesInDir
Changed check in choiceListBlanks, choiceListSelect from "value == False" to "not value". I was hesitant to use this because not None == True but it should be fine
Replaced some "value == True" with just "value" in places where value can only be a boolean because it does the same thing.
Added self.inStash to the check for discarding items in doProcess (I don't even know if this is used since doBag and doStash have their own)
Fixed item discard (when exiting the bag/stash) not making amount go away
Directly return result in checkMagicItem
Made the status of your balls show when self.showBalls == False and the grammar game tweak is active
[original game] Fixed region not changing back after submit and passOut in dungeon
[original game] Fixed region not changing to Cave Descent when entering the doOldCaveDecent from Firmshaft
Created a temporary fix to the formatting of the stats page using python's string formatting (it gets a little bit messy towards the bottom). Unfortuantely, this can't not be a perminant fix because tkhtmlview does not render fixed width fonts properly so I have to use normal fonts. This means that this only works when at default font size and is affected by outside factors.
Added persistant uv settings in the venvscript
Refactored the venvscript to use pathlib everywhere it can
Made venvscript not eat the help option. It can now pass it to other things
Removed redundant portions of the if/else statements in boobDesc, udderDesc, teatDesc, buttDesc, vulvaDesc, cockDesc, ballDesc, nipDesc, clitDesc, and hipDesc
[original game] Senarios that reference your balls now use self.showBalls to determine whether some things should be displayed. Before, this would not happen and some senarios would describe your balls even though they were not supposed to. I might have missed a few, but this is most of them.

v1.0.9
Requires as3lib version 0.0.9
Deobfuscated the rest of code and variables that were originally obfuscated
[original game] Fixed item amounts not going away if gainItem is called in the bag
Fixed the debug give item menu (the specified amount was given twice)
Added a couple of debug items to help with debug things. These items can only be obtained with the give item function of the debug window.
Replaced math.floor(a/b) with floor division. I have some parts of the original expressions alone where either things were affected by the change or where I wasn't sure if it would. Examples provided bellow
    Example 1:
        -math.floor(a/b) is the same as -(a//b) but not -a//b
    Example 2:
        math.floor(a/b)+c is the same as a//b+c
    Example 3:
        I'm not sure if math.floor(a/b+c) is the same as a//b+c
Made the save/load logic only use one xml library
Fixed a grammar mistake in doLust
Rewrote the logic for theme to work like fontColor. Theme should automatically switch to the new format on next launch.
Combined the save location variables. This will be automatically fixed the next time savePreferences is called
self.buttonsVisible and self.amountLabelsVisible are now lists instead of dictionaries which greatly speeds things up
Fixed save converter window not closing correctly. You should now be able to open it more than once per session.
Fixed a typo in item 218
Refactored hotKeys, showButtons, hideSidePanel, showSidePanel, initSidePanel, choiceListButtons, dayTime, saveGo, loadGo
Removed unnecessary imports (re, xml.minidom)
Fixed checkExistsMakeDir. It now doesn't try to create the directory every time and can use non-local paths
Used a variable to store a repetitive calculation in doWeight
Added .sol loading/saving capabilities (SOL Mode must be on to save using .sol files). Due to how I implemented this, you technically have 18 save slots now.
[original game] Fixed an issue with boobDesc where some values weren't accounted for.
Removed unnecessary comments
Added a new class called ButtonList to fix some issues with the buttonlists
Removed redundant variable definitions when game starts
Reworked stash to work like bag
Organized the variables in the init function and commented out ones that where also defined later (if one of them causes a problem I will uncomment it)
[original game] Fixed decGet when places is set to zero (ex: before it would output "50." instead of "50")
Removed a step from moistCalc making it one operation faster (directly return the final value instead of waiting till the end)
Replaced discard on shift with button to move items between bag/stash and gave discard its own button.
Fixed a bug in doEntice
Finished optimizing the rest of the functions to use outputMainText less
[original game] Fixed grammar mistakes in doOviasis senario 1 and 2
Fixed a bug in doImpregnate
Fixed bag/stash page number flashing when clicking on a button
[original game] Made bag return to the same page after selling an item
Directly used calculation in chooseFrom instead of storing it in a temperary variable (it was only used once)
Rearranged some if/else statements in appearanceGo to reduce the number of checks needed
Removed redundant checks from each shop's button layout placer
Removed the unnecessary button in doDyeShop and doApothecary
Changed "if i != 4 and i != 8 and i != 12" to "if i not in (4,8,12)" in the shops
Changed around the way amount is shown in bag so each one loads at the same time as its button instead of loading all at once after the buttons
[original game] Fixed the next/previous page buttons in the bag/stash when shift is held
[original game] Fixed the next/previous and return buttons when using hotkeys and holding shift in the bag/stash
MoveItemAmount now refreshes when swapping an item with an amount greater than 1 and an item with an amount of 1
Made the notation of all functions match
Removed unnecessary parts of the if/else statements in cumAmount
Implemented a check to see if saveLocation in the preferences file is valid
Added a missing "self." in legChange
[original game] Made bagPage reset after loading a game
Completely decoupled the page numbers of the different instances of the bag (bag, bag when selling, and stash)
Removed the massive forehead on the text area in the side box (I accidentally added it when converting the interface and didn't notice it until now)
Changed the variable "_str_" to "str_" because "_" before an object means something.
Added a popup to inform the user when loadPreferences fails and savelocation is invalid. I only included savelocation here because it is the only one that can really fuck up the game and possibly even your system. You should not see this unless loadPreferences fails to correct it.
Added doMultiImpregnate for times when doImpregnate is called multiple times in a row
Added a way to suppress the messages in doImpregnate and made doMultiImpregnate only able to show them once. (You should now only see the cock snake message once per event)
Changed the key to open the wiki to Tilde/Grave (`/~). This is to stay consistent with the rest of the game's hotkeys (It was designed to be used one handed, which makes a lot of sense considering the type of game this is)
[original game] Fixed a typo in doFirmshaft making the text not clear properly
[original game] Fixed a couple of things in doDairyFarm causing some text to never show
Made sure every instance of lactChange displayed properly.
In order to get enemyAttack to function properly, I had to make some modifications to doPassOut and doHP. If something doesn't look right, please let me know, I might have to revert the changes because it doesn't work.
[original game] Fixed a typo in enemyAttack where the clothesID should be -1 but was instead -2
Created a function called isBottomOpen which returns true if the clothes you are wearing on your bottom are open enough.
Made showButtons clear button text by default and added a parameter called bc to disable it. This gets rid of the couple of frames of text showing from the previous thing that was on screen.
[original game] Fixed an issue with vulvaDesc that could cause an error
Added game tweaks in the options window to tweak how certain aspects of the game function. These are things that change the game enough from the original that a toggle is justified. Tooltips to explain the options will be comming later, I need to refactor my custom widgets for that so it will take a while.
Fixed a grammar mistake in appearanceGo
loadGo is now able to display error messages from the loading process
Added proper error messaegs to the SOL/XML conversion functions and to doLoad
Added function hints to functions from checkItem to doShop
Fixed an issue where the "save/load from file" dialog broke in some versions of python
Removed double button presses after leaving doCaveDescent
Added a variable called self.goToInDoProcess which will change location in doProcess instead of when it was originally called. This is used instead of self.regionChange right before calling self.doEnd. This sometimes leads to a better looking result and will be used in places that make sense (like in doOldCaveDescent where each boss has a line which they say when you leave)
Rewrote the readme.
Implemented the ability to load .nim files
Fixed path resolution on Windows.
Made the status pane work like the original when pressing new game from the start screen
Made a new, cross platform virtual environment script that sets up the environment, downloads the game for you, and runs the game
Fixed something that I messed up in the description of hair. It is now able to be displayed.
Made files save in the right place on Windows.

v1.0.8 
Requires as3lib version 0.0.8
Changed sideEvent, hotkeys, getThemeColor, toggleColor, updateSide, choiceListButtons, choiceListSelect, regionChange, appearanceGo, saveGo, doSave, doBag, doItemUse, doProstitute, doVagMasturbate, makeAlchemy, doLevelUP, doSoftlik, doForest, doJungle, doPlains, doSavanna, doDesert, doBeach, doLake, doValley, doOldCaveDescent, knotholeUpstairs, weaponAttack, specialAbilityName, specialAbilityDescription, specialAbilityUse, doEntice, specialRapeWin, specialKOWin, specialKOLose, doeLust, enemyAttack, doStatus, aff, doBirth, legWhere, legPlural, milkAmount, buttonWrite, disableOneButton, writeAmount, viewAmount to use match-case (it is way faster, especially with huge statements, it also looks nicer. Note: I avoid saying it looks "cleaner" because I think the concept of clean code is dumb, I'll code however the fuck I want)
Changed some of the checks for buttonChoice to use match-case
Optimized doGeneral, doBag, doDiscard, doItemUse, doDayCare, doProstitute, doSleep, simpleAlchemy, complexAlchemy, advancedAlchemy, doLevelUP, doSoftlik, doPlains, doSavanna, doDesert, doValley, knotholeMain, knotholeUpstairs, doBattle, doEntice, doRape, doeLust, doStatus cockChange, cockLoss, vagChange, vagBellyChange, legChange, doBirth to use outputMainText less
Changed some of the save and load dialogue
Moved wiki over to my custom interface framework (it is now scalable)
Added option for doWeight to return text instead
Optimized toxml, checkMagicItem
Fixed toxml (I forgot the "self" parameter)
Added missing "self." to item 203 in itemDescription, item 110, 518, and 533 in doItemUse, dyeThing, doCockMasturbate, doSizCalit, doOviasis, doDairyFarm, doOldCave, doBirth, doLake, and a couple others (I went through every function individually and check every instance of them to make sure I didn't miss any). Variables will take me a long time so I won't be doing them yet.
Gave doHP, doPassOut, doJizzPants, specialKOLose, doeLust, cockChange, cockLoss, vagChange, vagBellyChange, legChange, lactChange, doBirth the ability to return their text output
Fixed item 232 in doItemUse
General code cleanup
Added hotkey support for windows
Added a missing doButtonChoices to dyeThing
Moved the return (leave) button in doDayCare to position 12 to match the rest of the actions in doGeneral (except doSleep)
Replaced everything that used my hack lists.push() with Array.push() from as3lib.toplevel
Optimized repintorfloat, strtobool, and Filexml.getdh to make loading save files faster
Changed the game font back to what it was originally
Consolidated the button#visible and amountlabel#visible variables into dictionaries (one for the buttons and one for the amount labels) and optimized all of the functions using them to utilize the features of dictionaries
Removed the remaining eval statements in the color change functions
Optimized the functions for the button panel
Replaced the height calculations in appearanceGo and doOldCave with floor division (//) for feet and modulo (%) for inches because they work faster than doing it manually.
Fixed updown images in battle (They sometimes didn't show or were overriden by others).
Replaced the save converter buttons with a single one and added it to the save game menu as well.
Replaced previous save converter with a nicer one.
Added a way to change the save file folder's name and its location.
Fixed view source button in context menu (I forgot to import webbrowser)
Replaced lambda with functools.partial
Added saveFolder and saveFolderLocation to Nimin_Prefs (Do not change these to anything that isn't valid on your os, I haven't implemented checks for that yet)
Converting saves to sol is now supported (Normal sol files will not work as .nim files, they are slightly different. I am currently working on conversion to nim files). Normal sol files MUST be inside the games shared object folder (/home/*username*/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObject/*gameid*/localhost on linux) folder and must be named Nimin_Save#.sol (# in the file name is any number between 1 and 11 excluding 4 and 8). This is due to the way the original game saves and loads save files.
Slightly optimized load times and added the command line option "-nostart" for debug. Prevents the game from initializing and displays all elements on the screen.
Added a way to discard items without closing the bag (while moving an item, hold shift and press button 12). I'm going to refer to this as "discard on shift".
Added a shift override to fix things in the bag.
    - Confirmation dialog for discarding an item (before this, if you hold shift it moved the item instead of selecting a choice).
    - (possibly) doItemUse
Finished the menus in the wiki
Removed unnessesary space in doCockMasturbate
Debug window now respects colour choice
Fixed the xml definition tag in the save files and preferences
Made hotkeys work with discard on shift (this refers to something earlier in the changelog) in bag.
Added a give item menu to the debug window
Removed the borders from the scrolled text areas to be more consistant with the original game. This can be changed back by changing the variable originaltextboxstyle in __init__ to False however, due to the nature of this and how it is implemented currently in interface_tk, this must be changed before opening the game.

v1.0.7
PYTHON VERSION DEPENDENCY HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 3.10 (I wanted to use match-case)
Put the program back into a main class, removed all of the global statements
Fixed bug with doRace
Optimized doRace, doGender, bodyType, itemDescription, doDayCare, doSleep, doItemUse (itemID 208, 218, 507, 512, 517, 522), doLevelUP, doDen, doSizCalit, doStartingDescription, domName, goodsID, apothName, apothValue, hairstyleName, hairC, hairstyleValue, clothesID, clothesValue, makeAlchemy, plural slightly
Changed some of the strings to format strings to remove some complexity
Fixed checkOpenSlot
Fixed stashStore and stashRemove
Fixed doDayCare
Optimized if else statements in doCockMasturbate
Replaced some if else statements with the plural() function because that's its purpose
Optimized lilaDesc
Fixed double spacing in enemyAttack
[original game] Fixed a spelling mistake in enemyAttack for enemyID 309
[original game] Fixed a variable spelling mistake in enemyAttack
Actually fixed the lust stat this time (the game now checks it every time it is displayed instead of just when stats is called)
Reduced the number of outputMainText calls and fixed the order of the "_Desc()" functions so they display correctly in doItemUse (itemID 110 and 533)
[original game] Fixed itemID 517 and 522 to use showBalls correctly
[original game]Fixed spelling mistake in doItemUse itemID 534
Removed a useless line in doGeneral which was causing an error
Added a detailed debug window. Enable it by passing the argument "-debug" when running the game
[original game] Added a way to escape from zone 1 senario 6 in doProstitute
Added a menu bar similar to the one in adobe flash player projector
[original game] Fixed issue in doDairyFarm where some text didn't show when it was supposed to (it was a mistype)
Made lilaDesc work like the other _Desc functions and fixed it where it appears
Fixed doApothecary (I forgot a line so it didn't work)
Made all shops return to doShops if you hold shift when you press the return button.
Optimized doLust to use outputMainText less
Changed doLust slightly so it can now return the output text instead of displaying it (must set function parameter "ret" to "True" to use)
Updated the frist line of code so that it properly executes on most instances of linux (if you don't have your bin directory in root, symlink or actual directory, it won't run)
Added missing "self." in doLoad
Moved quit button to menu
About window now changes colour with the rest of the stuff
Changed interface to use the custom library that I made (it is slightly slower now but it's resizable).
Added option to doHP to suppress image change for things like new game
[original game] Rearranged the hideUpDown command in newGameGo to make it work better
Fixed the venv setup script
Changed itemDescription, passiveItemAdd, passiveItemRemove, doItemUse, goodsID, dyeID, apothID, apothLearn, apothDescription, hairDesc, hairL, hairstyleID, hairstyleLength, hairstyleDescription, clothesName, clothesDescription, clothesTop, clothesBottom, pullUD, clothesChange, enemyName, enemyBaseStats, enemyBaby, earDesc, faceDesc, skinDesc, skinC, legDesc, legVerb, regionName, raceName, domName, genName, tailDesc, humanTaurTailDesc to use match-case (it is way faster, especially with huge statements)
Changed the save file location to be in a subfolder instead of in the same directory (reduces clutter)
[original game] Fixed doJizzPants triggering sometimes after closing bag (should be fixed)
Fixed appearance button not working when detailedCredits is shown without the sidebar
Fixed humanTaurTailDesc

v1.0.6
Fixed buttonpanel width
Switched frames to tkinter.Frame instead of tkinter.ttk.Frame so that I could change the background colour directly
Removed the background colour labels and the ttk import as they aren't needed anymore
Temporarily disabled window resizing as it doesn't work anyways
Temporarily locked the aspect ratio just in case the previous fix fails
Remove unnecessary functions in my lists extension class
Removed functions I added at the beggining of the project that are no longer needed
Removed code that I commented out but forgot to remove
Optimized doWeight
Optimized doHP
Optimized doLust
Fixed dojizzpants not triggering correctly when going back to dogeneral from areas
[original game] Fixed dojizzpants next button having to be pressed twice
Fixed checkStash
Removed the "this." statement that I missed

v1.0.5
[original game] Made shops always go back to themselves instead of going back to another shop in some cases
Fixed a bug with the Apothecary
Fixed a bug with the Tailor
Optimized itemName, usableItem, itemValue, itemMaxStack, foodItem
Fixed Milking Machine (Item)
Added ,0 to the end of all max() functions with only one input because python can't handle only one input
Added a missing global varible definition to affinityChange
Fixed Array.concat()
Made Save Game, Load Game, and New Game buttons appear and disappear when they are supposed to
Fixed a couple of bugs with doProstitute
Fixed a couple of bugs with doLevelUP
Fixed checkOpenSlot to find first open slot not last open slot
Fixed hotkeys being able to press disabled buttons
Fix levels not saving
Fix bug with amounts not showing sometimes
Fixed a bug with checkMagicItem
Remove a bunch of the this. statements that I missed
Fixed a bug with doDairyFarm
Fixed a bug with eventSelect
Fixed the cancel button in itemUse for item 213
(Should be fixed) Fixed lust sometimes becoming a random float value
(Should be fixed) Fixed shapshifty so it only increases one affinity (very inconsistantly happened with equan and random others)
[original game] Fixed a couple of spelling mistake in doProstitute
[original game] Fixed a bug in enemyAttack for enemy 102
Optimized item 108 so it isn't unbearably slow to use

v1.0.4
Fixed bug with item buying/selling

v1.0.3
Fixed bag/stash navigation
Fixed keysUp function

v1.0.2rev2
Fixed platform import

v1.0.2rev1
Made hotkeys only work on systems that I've tried and made a placeholder for the rest (keycodes are system dependent but I'm not sure if tkinter is picky about linux distributions (only tried on debian and fedora so far)). All keycodes that I can get are based off of US standard keyboards and [this table](http://gcctech.org/csc/javascript/javascript_keycodes.htm).

v1.0.2
(Mostly) Fixed hotkeys
Broke bag/stash navigation
Fixed item moving, broke bag/stash navigation after moving items so don't move items for now

v1.0.1
Fixed bug where save converter buttons wouldn't go away
Switched from using tkinter.ScrolledText to tkhtmlview.HTMLScrolledText (font styling should work now)

v1.0.0
Changed str variable to _str_ because it conflicts with a built in function
Removed "this." statements
Rearranged some statements to make more sense
Converted variables before displaying them to the screen because "TypeError: can only concatenate str (not 'int') to str"
Changed "\r" to "\n"
Replaced "||" with "or" and "&&" with "and"
Commented out unused parts of the original code instead of removing them
Interface rewritten in tkinter becuase it looked the most similar to the original
Removed backslashes before single quotes where they weren't necessary because python knows how to handle single quotes within double quotes and can tell the difference between the two
Pointed functions to the correct place in python (ex: in flash it's Math.random() but in python it's random.random())
Save data and preferences are now stored in xml format instead of shared objects because I couldn't find any libraries for action messaging format that still worked. If I get around to it, I might make my own library or at least make a way to convert old save files to new ones but that is a lot of work and amf is very confusing
Remade images 1 and 2 to be centered
Added addManyItems command to replace multiple itemAdd functions with the same item next to each other
Merged some redundant if statements
Created a disable button function to disable buttons when not used but on screen
Changed shops to use disable button functions for empty slots

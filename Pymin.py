There’s a primal urgency in the men’s thrusts. They’re not there to pleasure you, this is all about them. The man behind you gives your {self.buttDesc()} rump a sharp slap, causing you to squeal around the cock in your mouth.

She soon has you screaming at the sensation of your cock being squeezed and milked by her perfect cunt. The other sister is now vigorously jacking herself off with the hand previously probing the depths of her pussy, using her own juices as a lubricant. It's only a matter of time before the sensation of your cock being milked within the steaming depths of this drunken beauty causes you to orgasm.\n\nYou stifle a scream as you tense and begin to forcefully ejaculate deep into her.

Yeah, this is my place. I-I guess I should show you now?\" Blush spreads as he asks and deepens even more as you nod. \"A-Alright...\"\n\nStill sitting, he begins to unlatch the waistband of his shorts and shimmy out of them. The round sheath is exposed first, thick with much fleshy padding and a little bit of skin showing in the center as something holds itself back. Then the tops of the large orbs are exposed, so smooth and soft compared to the rest of his fur-covered body. He has to take special care to cradle them up out of his shorts with a palm so he can finish pulling the clothing down without tugging on himself. Once emptied, the shorts quickly fall down to his ankles, allowing him to spread his knees and let the things hang. And gosh do they hang... Nearly touching the piled cloth on the floor while he sits on the bed, they look like large living almonds in stretched fleshy sacks that rise and fall slowly as the testicles shift to the cooler air.

So you do, kneading them gently as you make your way up, causing a surprised yet pleasured snort to come out of the boy. Then you feel the scrotum below his sheath, a few inches of it stretched downward to hold the huge things, so thin comparatively yet still so thick. A bit ticklish as well, elliciting some more snorting as he shudders spontaneously.\n\nIt doesn't take long before you make it to the sheath, however. A head already poking its way through, despite the boy's best efforts to hold it back, an erection gradually grows out as you study it. Almost as warm as the balls below, the sheath gives off its own warmth, with a much more plush sensation as well. You can actually grab it and squeeze it, your fingers easily descending into the meaty flesh. It's also quite weighty as well, maybe not so much as the testicles but enough to quickly plop back down into your hands as you try to toss up the thick ring of flesh a little. It only grows heavier as the cock draws out from it.\n\nThe long rod of stiff sausage easily reaches over your shoulder from this distance, resting against your neck. The skin is sort of leathery by the way it stretches out and has a bit of shiny reflection to it, but rather thin and pliable in your hands. You can easily feel the skin move beneath your fingertips as you stroke across it, moving separately from the blood-engorged meat within.

The pole drags over your shoulder, making it even harder and heavier, the tip starting to drool with pre down to the floor behind you. You prepare the reduced reduction, smearing the paste between your hands before palming the overgrown fruits before you.\n\nHe shudders as the cool liquid counters the heat of his loins. The balls are meaty within your grip, giving off their own warmth as cum is churned about within, and they recoil back up towards his abdomen to escape the chilled touch. Not that they can actually get away from you, especially at that size, so you still manage to rub the concoction thoroughly into the swollen scrotum.

By the time you reach the flaring tip of the equine glans, the boy lets out a timid whinny, the slightly shrunken balls groaning as the now excessive amount of cum left within is launched through the narrowing barrel.

The substantial penis still thumps against his chest as it relaxes, though barely able to pass his sternum. The spheres below only reach halfway down his thighs now and already seem like they'll actually 'fit' inside his shorts. Still rather large overall, but not much larger than any other guy in this town.\n\nA few more pants and the boy comes to his senses. \"Oh! I'm so sorry about that! I... I didn't know you were going to be that... 'attentive' about the whole thing...\" You laugh a little and just shrug it off, wiping off another gob and nonchalantly flicking it to the floor below.

Pulling up the waist band over the girth, he can barely squeeze in most of the shaft. Yet, the flaring head refuses to hide, blatantly poking out over the side by his hip. \"Well, almost. But I'm sure it will be much easier to manage now, thank you!\" He lunges forward and embraces you in a grateful hug. Though, in the process of doing so, the button of his shorts comes undone and the package leaps free, giving you a good hearty thump to the chest.\n\nOnce he notices the sensation of his 'little' man being pressed up between your bodies, he hastily parts and apologizes again. \"Oops, so sorry about that...\" He averts his eyes in embarassment, but also begins to think as he looks around, his fingers balling up the sheets around his hands in contemplation and hesitation. \"Umm...

You take his hand with a chuckle and shake it back, only to be interupted by another splatter across your hands. He rolls his eyes and insists that you head out before you get any messier.

It's quickly replaced by the tube top, his small frame fitting the small garment well.

As it rises to his knees, he angles his member downward, catching it between his knees and behind the waistband of the garment, allowing the skirt to easily rise to his waist without obstruction.

He shifts a bit in a crude attempt to make things better before presenting himself, but he eventually gives up and lets out a sigh. Eyes closed, he twirls around.\n\n\"There...\"\n\nThis time he didn't bother to wedge certain parts up into the tube top. Instead, the large cock reaches out at full stiffness, held down by the skirt. The garment doesn't have much give though; with the bulbous testicles making the cloth tight around his thighs, the cock almost points straight down, hardly lifting the skirt at all. He didn't even bother with the panties this time, probably having learned his lesson, and didn't take care to prop his cock up into his tube top, which is good for what you're planning.\n\n\"Happy now?,\" he says with a disgruntled look on his face, even though his cock seems even stiffer now.\n\nYou smile in pleasure with no desire to laugh.

The tautness in the skirt shifts with the manuever, making him appear far girlier from the front as the skirt lays flat against his dainty figure. Of course, his backside looks far more masculine with the thick sausage wedged against his thighs down past his knees with the orbs looking like a second rump beneath the skirt, but that's fine. You're able to conceal it mostly by stepping up behind him, at which point you begin to push him out of his tent.\n\n\"Wait! No! Don't!\" His cries go unheeded and immediately stop as he is pushed outside.\n\nThe boy stands there silently, trying not to draw any attention. His thighs clench around his genitals, desparately trying to prevent them from popping out. After several moments, he begins to realize that nobody is giving him a second thought as they pass by. With his monster tucked behind him, nobody is the wiser. They simply regard him as some flat-chested girl, not particularly ugly or pretty, maybe even a little cute...\n\nAs you feel him relax in front of you, you resume pushing him from behind. A little awkward and resistant at first, he stumbles while trying to keep things hidden. Quickly enough, however, he starts to learn how to walk with his thighs shut, giving him a rather exaggerated feminine swing to his hips. He even begins to break away from your pushing, taking the lead in having a nice stroll around the town. You remain close, of course, to ensure nobody sees the throbbing thing that pokes out behind him, especially as it seems to grow stiffer, the veins bulging from the slightly restricted bloodflow from his clamped thighs. It gets even more difficult to cover him as gobs of pre begin to leak out from the tip, spilling over your {self.legDesc(10)} and making the ground mildly slick.\n\nThe boy is obviously becoming more and more aroused, the reddening cock beginning to buck with his pulse from becoming so sensitive. His thighs squeeze the base of the shaft more, his hips gently thrusting to pull the rod through the tight space between his legs. With each step, he practically humps his own legs, pre dribbling from the tip in large wads while he sighs and moans. His pace slows the further he goes, his tail twitching and tickling the underside of the monster, his whole body jerking as it tries to maintain its composure. Just as he's about to stop, unable to press on any further, you step out and push him, immediately turning his back up against the canvas wall of the nearest tent.\n\nYou watch as his eyes flutter up into his head, a meek moan echoing out of his mouth. The lewd sound of wet splattering is quite audible and you take caution to cover it up from the public. Thick jet after thick jet of pearly warm whiteness launches from behind his legs, smattering the canvas as well as the back of his legs and over his ankles. The cock is oh so red from the built up blood within, so stiff and veiny that it's almost difficult to tell which bulge the hot spunk is pulsing out from. If you weren't actively keeping his legs closed as you stand before him, that thing would have likely broken through and spewed all over some unsuspecting citizens. Even as it is, the thing takes nearly a full minute to finish unloading its seed, the testicles bouncing against his ass as they throb while the rod bobs on its own accord. For an ejaculation without touching the most sensitive locations, it sure does have a good deal of pressure to it.",True)

Despite having climaxed so much, his cock remains stiff, unwilling to settle down after such an ordeal. It continues to ooze spunk down the back of his legs as you hurriedly push him away from the tent, leaving behind a rather large puddle before anybody can notice it while you're around. The boy is still in a mental haze, coming down from the numbing orgasm, and doesn't take too much care to hold onto his cock anymore. As you push him home, his legs don't hold as tightly and the thing between them begins to slip through. If it weren't for its large girth, it would have probably done so in a single step, but instead can only wedge through little by little. It's not until you reach his home does it finally spring free, catching the attention of a random bystander. Fortunately, they're far too confused to process what they just saw before you disappear inside, keeping the boy's secret safe.\n\nUsing some of the towels around his room, you help clean up legs and wipe off the drooling cock. It eventually slips back into his sheath beneath the skirt as he regains his composure.\n\n\"That... That... That was...\" The blushing deepens in his face as his mind begins to process all that just happened. He sits down on his bed, wincing in pain before spreading his legs and pulling his balls to the front. He rubs himself through the skirt while trying to keep the skirt as tidy as possible, seemingly enjoying it. \"I think I liked that more than I should...\" He utters in an honest but sheepish tone.\n\nYou immediately give him a hug, letting him know that there was nothing wrong in enjoying it. That's why you wanted him to do it, after all.\n\nIt takes a moment, but he returns the embrace. \"Thank you. That didn't really help my issues, but... I think I can appreciate certain... 'aspects' about it. I can't say that I won't be looking forward to doing something like that again...\" He trails off, but then breaks from the embrace in surprise. \"Oh my! After all that I have never even introduced myself! M-My name is Jamie. Kinda ironic, I guess, since that's also a girl's name, but I do kinda feel good looking like this.\" Again, he blushes in embarassment, but this time he's wearing a warm smile with it.\n\n\"Umm... \" He tugs at his skirt, trying to get it to hold taut over the hills of his testicles so the fabric can't lay against his sheath, where a blotch is starting to form. \"I should really get to cleaning up before I ruin the outfit. It took me so long last time... I'll be keeping an eye out for you in town though. I do hope to... enjoy more time with you.\"\n\nYou return his smile and give him a nod. After another quick hug with the boy wearing a tube top, you make your way out of the tent to give him some time.",True)

He blinks for a moment after he swallows, beginning to blush as a warmth flows through his body. When that warmth reaches his loins, the whole length of thick meat bucks in return and sending him sprawling backwards onto his bed. He braces himself upon his sheets, his eyes closing and his teeth clenching while things begin to shift and swell.\n\nThe pole upon your shoulder begins to rise, lifting itself from the expanding flesh. If it weren't so large, it could have stood straight up, but instead it bends in the middle, jerking in the air with the growth from each beat of his heart. Gobs of pre ooze lazily from the widening tip, drooling down over your head until you move back a bit for cover.\n\nWhile the shaft above continues to rise and swell, the orbs below also groan with growth. You can see them shift about, urging his legs to spread wider to give them some room. They tug at his crotch, pulling the scrotum down with their increasing weight. You hear an \"Nnngh\" as the tightness and heaviness of the scrotum becomes uncomfortable for the poor prone boy.\n\nBefore things could 'grow' more dire, you take it upon yourself to assist him with a hands-on approach. Specifically, your hands reach out for the throbbing flared equine cockhead that leans in your direction. Your fingertips knead into the soft and plush yet rigid and rough glans, the blood beneath pressing back at your touch with great intensity. You stand to lift the pillar of meat up, holding the tower up in the air so it's not depending on its own strength. The massaging of your fingers over the tender expanding flesh as you hug it makes the boy shiver with a snort.\n\nLarge wads of gooey cum leap heavily from the hole between your fingers, splattering up over your arm. They don't fly much further, too thick and weighty. And with the widening barrel of the loaded cannon, the rest of the spunk gurgles out from the tip like a slowly erupting volcano, the molten stuff surging over your hands and back down its length. However, what the ejaculation lacked in velocity it made up for with quantity...\n\nThe stuff doesn't stop gurgling from the tip as the tower continues its growth. The relief to his testicles barely keeps up with their swelling size, preventing any more discomfort, but in turn leaving him constantly moaning and softly neighing with gob after gob of sticky spooge drooling out of his erection. Your hands rapidly become soaked with a warm blanket of white, his bed sheets becoming shiny and heavy with pearlescant moisture.

His hands grope around himself, feeling how heavier and swollen he has become. \"Geeze... If I looked awkward before, now I must really be a freak...\" He looks up at your smiling face. \"But... You enjoy it like this? I... I guess as long as one person does, it's alright. Plus I must be close to being the 'manliest' man in Firmshaft with a package like this...\" He sits up and hefts up the scrotum and puffy sheath, letting them fall back down between his legs with a slight wince from the tugging of the greater weight.\n\nWith a grimace, he begins to stand. White sheets of thick cum flow down from his body, making an even bigger mess around his feet. He wobbles a bit as he acclimates to his new size, feeling a little hunched as his balls hang down to his knees. \"Eww... It's going to take a while to clean up the mess that... I made... And, umm...

As you step inside, it's much of what you'd expect from a bachelor's pad. A somewhat disheveled kitchen area, an exposed bathing tub, a large bed with a curtain around it, several crunchy-looking towels around the floor of his bed...\n\nThe boy is quick to kick the 'evidence' under his bed and sits down. \"Sooo... Yeah, this is my place. I-I guess I should change now...\"\n\nHe kneels down before the bed to grope about beneath it, moving aside some towels until he grabs some other fabrics. The same tube top and skirt you first saw him wearing, he had been hiding it under his bed this whole time.\n\nWith his back to you, the boy finishes stripping by removing his shirt. It's quickly replaced by the tube top, his small frame fitting the small garment well. Then, his tail swishes a bit, giving you flashes of his tight rump, while he steps into the skirt and pulls it up. As it rises to his knees, his member grows outward with arousal and he's forced to angle it downward, catching it between his knees and behind the waistband of the garment, allowing the skirt to easily rise to his waist without obstruction. The rod pushes his testicles back between his thighs, forcing his legs to bend to give the package room until he can secure the girly thing at his waist. Once it's on, he's able to release the kraken, letting it flick forward with his thighs closing, pulling the hem of the skirt taut just above his knees. He shifts a bit in a crude attempt to make things better before presenting himself, but he eventually gives up and lets out a sigh. Eyes closed, he twirls around.\n\n\"There...\"\n\nThis time he didn't bother to wedge certain parts up into the tube top. Instead, the large cock reaches out at full stiffness, held down by the skirt. The skirt does have too much give though; with the bulbous testicles making the cloth tight around his thighs, the cock almost points straight down, hardly lifting the skirt at all. He didn't even bother with the panties this time, probably having learned his lesson, and didn't take care to prop his cock up into his tube top, which is good for what you're planning.\n\n\"Happy now?,\" he says with a disgruntled look on his face, even though his cock seems even stiffer now.\n\nYou smile in pleasure with no desire to laugh. You look him over, making sure to give him the feeling that you like what you see.

You yank his testicles until his scrotum stretches to his rump, the orbs nestling below it like another pair of cheeks. Then, to ensure they don't snap back, you pull the erection through his thighs as well, locking it up against his crotch as you push his legs back together. The tautness in the skirt shifts with the manuever, making him appear far girlier from the front as the skirt lays flat against his dainty figure. Of course, his backside looks far more masculine with the thick sausage wedged against his thighs down past his knees with the orbs looking like a second rump beneath the skirt, but that's fine. You're able to conceal it mostly by stepping up behind him, at which point you begin to push him out of his tent.\n\n\"Wait! No! Don't!\" His cries go unheeded and immediately stop as he is pushed outside.\n\nThe boy stands there silently, trying not to draw any attention. His thighs clench around his genitals, desparately trying to prevent them from popping out. After several moments, he begins to realize that nobody is giving him a second thought as they pass by. With his monster tucked behind him, nobody is the wiser. They simply regard him as some flat-chested girl, not particularly ugly or pretty, maybe even a little cute...\n\nAs you feel him relax in front of you, you resume pushing him from behind. A little awkward and resistant at first, he stumbles while trying to keep things hidden. Quickly enough, however, he starts to learn how to walk with his thighs shut, giving him a rather exaggerated feminine swing to his hips. He even begins to break away from your pushing, taking the lead in having a nice stroll around the town. You remain close, of course, to ensure nobody sees the throbbing thing that pokes out behind him, especially as it seems to grow stiffer, the veins bulging from the slightly restricted bloodflow from his clamped thighs. It gets even more difficult to cover him as gobs of pre begin to leak out from the tip, spilling over your {self.legDesc(10)} and making the ground mildly slick.\n\nThe boy is obviously becoming more and more aroused, the reddening cock beginning to buck with his pulse from becoming so sensitive. His thighs squeeze the base of the shaft more, his hips gently thrusting to pull the rod through the tight space between his legs. With each step, he practically humps his own legs, pre dribbling from the tip in large wads while he sighs and moans. His pace slows the further he goes, his tail twitching and tickling the underside of the monster, his whole body jerking as it tries to maintain its composure. Just as he's about to stop, unable to press on any further, you step out and push him, immediately turning his back up against the canvas wall of the nearest tent.\n\nYou watch as his eyes flutter up into his head, a meek moan echoing out of his mouth. The lewd sound of wet splattering is quite audible and you take caution to cover it up from the public. Thick jet after thick jet of pearly warm whiteness launches from behind his legs, smattering the canvas as well as the back of his legs and over his ankles. The cock is oh so red from the built up blood within, so stiff and veiny that it's almost difficult to tell which bulge the hot spunk is pulsing out from. If you weren't actively keeping his legs closed as you stand before him, that thing would have likely broken through and spewed all over some unsuspecting citizens. Even as it is, the thing takes nearly a full minute to finish unloading its seed, the testicles bouncing against his ass as they throb while the rod bobs on its own accord. For an ejaculation without touching the most sensitive locations, it sure does have a good deal of pressure to it.",True)

Despite having climaxed so much, his cock remains stiff, unwilling to settle down after such an ordeal. It continues to ooze spunk down the back of his legs as you hurriedly push him away from the tent, leaving behind a rather large puddle before anybody can notice it while you're around. The boy is still in a mental haze, coming down from the numbing orgasm, and doesn't take too much care to hold onto his cock anymore. As you push him home, his legs don't hold as tightly and the thing between them begins to slip through. If it weren't for its large girth, it would have probably done so in a single step, but instead can only wedge through little by little. It's not until you reach his home does it finally spring free, catching the attention of a random bystander. Fortunately, they're far too confused to process what they just saw before you disappear inside, keeping the boy's secret safe.\n\nUsing some of the towels around his room, you help clean up legs and wipe off the drooling cock. It eventually slips back into his sheath beneath the skirt as he regains his composure.\n\n\"That... That... That was...\" The blushing deepens in his face as his mind begins to process all that just happened. He sits down on his bed, wincing in pain before spreading his legs and pulling his balls to the front. He rubs himself through the skirt while trying to keep the skirt as tidy as possible, seemingly enjoying it. \"I think I liked that more than I should...\" He utters in an honest but sheepish tone.\n\nYou immediately give him a hug, letting him know that there was nothing wrong in enjoying it. That's why you wanted him to do it, after all.\n\nIt takes a moment, but he returns the embrace. \"Thank you. That didn't really help my issues, but... I think I can appreciate certain... 'aspects' about it. I can't say that I won't be looking forward to doing something like that again...\" He trails off, but then breaks from the embrace in surprise. \"Oh my! After all that I have never even introduced myself! M-My name is Jamie. Kinda ironic, I guess, since that's also a girl's name, but I do kinda feel good looking like this.\" Again, he blushes in embarassment, but this time he's wearing a warm smile with it.\n\n\"Umm... \" He tugs at his skirt, trying to get it to hold taut over the hills of his testicles so the fabric can't lay against his sheath, where a blotch is starting to form. \"I should really get to cleaning up before I ruin the outfit. It took me so long last time... I'll be keeping an eye out for you in town though. I do hope to... enjoy more time with you.\"\n\nYou return his smile and give him a nod.

You pop the pill into his mouth while he is caught slack jawed and off guard, forcing him to swallow before he's aware of what happened.

When that warmth reaches his loins, the whole length of thick meat bucking in return and sending him sprawling back into the tent wall behind him. He braces himself against the canvas, his eyes closing and his teeth clenching while things begin to shift and swell.\n\nThe thing snaps the button of his shorts, making the lad's shirt flutter with the growing girth caught inside. The outline of his bulge becomes more visible, making the pulsing veins more apparent as they stand stiffly. They slowly reacher higher and higher, the large rod inside crawling up his belly and chest, the flaring head dragging across the inside of the fabric. He shivers from the sensation before grunting as the glans catches on the collar of his shirt. The meat bends slightly outward at the middle, unable to pass the simple barrier from the swelling alone. His muscles reflexively jerk at the base, making the whole thing wriggle and buck some more. Eventually, the monster manages to jiggle out, the tip springing up from the collar and launching a gob of pre from the sensitized head to his cheek.\n\nWhile the shaft above continues to rise, the orbs below also groan with growth. You can see them shift about, easily holding up his shorts from the tension, even with the broken button. The garment soon becomes strained with small creaking sounds around the thighs. The stallion looks rather distraught, twisting his hips around with an \"Nnngh\" as the testicles begin to squeeze themselves within the confines. His clothes were beginning to produce an unpleasant pressure with his pent-up arousal.\n\nBefore things could 'grow' more dire, you take it upon yourself to assist him with a hands-on approach. Specifically, your hands reach out for the throbbing flared equine cockhead that currently brushes against the boyn's cheek as it rises. Your fingertips knead into the soft and plush yet rigid and rough glans, the blood beneath pressing back at your touch with great intensity. The massaging of your fingers over the tender expanding flesh makes the boy shiver with a snort.\n\nLarge wads of gooey cum leap heavily from the hole between your fingers, splattering up the side of his face and ear. They don't fly much further, too thick and weighty. And with the widening barrel of the loaded cannon, the rest of the spunk gurgles out from the tip like a slowly erupting volcano, the molten stuff surging over your hands and back down its length. However, what the ejaculation lacked in velocity it made up for with quantity...\n\nThe stuff doesn't stop gurgling from the tip as the tower continues its growth. The relief to his testicles barely keeps up with their swelling size, preventing any more discomfort, but in turn leaving him constantly moaning and softly neighing with gob after gob of sticky spooge drooling out of his erection. Your hands rapidly become soaked with a warm blanket of white, his shirt becoming shiny and heavy with pearlescant moisture. The coarse hair of his tail swishes from side to side against the canvas he leans on, his body jerking slightly with each load.",True)

His hands grope around himself, feeling how heavier and swollen he has become. \"Geeze... If I looked awkward before, now I must really be a freak...\" He looks up at your smiling face. \"But... You enjoy it like this? I... I guess as long as one person does, it's alright. Plus I must be close to being the 'manliest' man in Firmshaft with a package like this...\" He hefts up the scrotum and puffy sheath, letting them fall back down into his lap with a slight wince from the greater weight and a splash from the puddle below.\n\nWith a grimace, he begins to stand. White sheets of thick cum flow down from his body, making an even bigger mess around his feet. He wobbles a bit as he acclimates to his new size, feeling a little hunched as his balls hang down to his knees. \"Eww... We should probably get out of here before anybody sees the mess that...

Pushing him back, the boy concedes to your efforts and slumps to the ground, allowing your hand to ride down the shaft and lubricate it well. Getting down on your {self.legDesc(6)}, you wrap your other hand around the girth just above the first, and slowly begin to pump up and down the rippling flesh like you were churning butter.

You watch it slowly drool down the cleft of his glans and polish the thick bulging shaft as it travels down. He watches you intently as you stare at the clear fluid and tenses when your tongue lunges forward, touching his skin and catching the large drop before it reaches the halfway point down the monster. The boy shivers and quakes as you lick the slimy bead back up the path it came, making the cock buck when your tongue drags back over the cleft and the balls throb below as your mouth manages its best to engulf the tip of the sizeable appendage.\n\nWarm and slightly salty, a very meaty flavor fills your maw, so much that your lips are stretched and your jaw strains to hold it in.

The taste of spunk is all you can recognize with all the stuff rushing back out and down his length, pooling around his testicles.

I didn't know you were going to be that... 'attentive' about the whole thing...\" You laugh a little and just shrug it off, wiping off another gob and nonchalantly flicking it to the grass below. The boy nods back with a growing smile, looking down to inspect your handiwork. \"Oh wow! This... This looks almost normal! It even feels lighter!\" He performs a small hop, allowing the bits to bounce and swing about. \"Hey, I think these can even fit now!\" Rapidly, he tucks his testicles back into his shorts, both things easily fitting in and hardly showing through the fabric, and he bends the still stiff erection off to the side. Pulling up the waist band over the girth, he can barely squeeze in most of the shaft. Yet, the flaring head refuses to hide, blatantly poking out over the side by his hip. \"Well, almost. But I'm sure it will be much easier to manage now, thank you!\" He lunges forward and embraces you in a grateful hug. Though, in the process of doing so, the button of his shorts comes undone and the package leaps free, smacking you in the belly as well.\n\nOnce he notices the sensation of his 'little' man being pressed up between your bodies, he hastily parts and apologizes again. \"Oops, so sorry about that...\" He averts his eyes in embarassment, but also begins to think as he looks into the distance, a foot burrowing into the ground as it twists in contemplation and hesitation. \"Umm... I... I really appreciate the care you've given me, helping me out and all. I don't want to seem to forward, but... I'll try to keep more of an eye out for you when you're here in Firmshaft... I'd like to do more with you!\" A big grin fills his face.\n\nA stranger's voice speaks up from around the corner of one of the tents. \"I think the other side of the wall that made the weird squishing splattering sound was over here... I'll look between us and the neighbors, you look up on the roof to see if anything fell.\"\n\nThe boy's eyes go wide, darting to the large splotch of fresh cum drooling down the canvas. \"Uh oh, we better go!\"\n\nHe grabs your hand and pulls you out through the other end of the alley. He glances from side to side to make sure nobody saw, but a pair of eyes in the distance reminds him of something crucial. \"No! I'm still exposed!\" He grabs his bouncing shaft, fumbling around to try and get it back under his shirt. \"Thanks again, but we really need to split up and get out of here before we get caught! I hope I'll see you around again! Oh, and my name is Jamie!\"\n\nJamie attempts to wave goodbye, but winds up letting his monster flop out again. He desperatly dashes off between another couple of tents, tying to keep hidden until he can correct himself, leaving you to head off in another direction.\n\nWith a chuckle, you stride off, just moments before you hear an \"Ewwww\" from whence you just came...",True)

He looks into your eyes to see if you were just joking, but you don't give him any such sign. So, slowly, he concedes. \"You... You would actually like that? I-I suppose I could put it on again. Just... Don't laugh, okay?\"\n\nYou give him an eager nod, ensuring that he's safe with you.\n\n\"O-Okay. But we'll have to go back to my place first, that's where the, umm... 'outfit' is...\"\n\nYou follow his lead and head towards his home. It's not exactly a large tent, but it doesn't need to be either. As you step inside, it's much of what you'd expect from a bachelor's pad. A somewhat disheveled kitchen area, an exposed bathing tub, a large bed with a curtain around it, several crunchy-looking towels around the floor of his bed...\n\nThe boy is quick to kick the 'evidence' under his bed and sits down. \"Sooo... Yeah, this is my place. I-I guess I should change now...\"\n\nHe kneels down before the bed to grope about beneath it, moving aside some towels until he grabs some other fabrics. The same tube top and skirt you first saw him wearing, he had been hiding it under his bed this whole time.\n\nWith his back to you, the boy finishes stripping by removing his shirt. It's quickly replaced by the tube top, his small frame fitting the small garment well. Then, his tail swishes a bit, giving you flashes of his tight rump, while he steps into the skirt and pulls it up. As it rises to his knees, his member grows outward with arousal and he's forced to angle it downward, catching it between his knees and behind the waistband of the garment, allowing the skirt to easily rise to his waist without obstruction. The rod pushes his testicles back between his thighs, forcing his legs to bend to give the package room until he can secure the girly thing at his waist. Once it's on, he's able to release the kraken, letting it flick forward with his thighs closing, pulling the hem of the skirt taut just above his knees. He shifts a bit in a crude attempt to make things better before presenting himself, but he eventually gives up and lets out a sigh. Eyes closed, he twirls around.\n\n\"There...\"\n\nThis time he didn't bother to wedge certain parts up into the tube top. Instead, the large cock reaches out at full stiffness, held down by the skirt. The skirt does have too much give though; with the bulbous testicles making the cloth tight around his thighs, the cock almost points straight down, hardly lifting the skirt at all. He didn't even bother with the panties this time, probably having learned his lesson, and didn't take care to prop his cock up into his tube top, which is good for what you're planning.\n\n\"Happy now?,\" he says with a disgruntled look on his face, even though his cock seems even stiffer now.\n\nYou smile in pleasure with no desire to laugh. You look him over, making sure to give him the feeling that you like what you see. You step behind him and begin to brush at his hair, combing it into a more stylish, girly appearance that matches the skirt. Then you duck down and make the confused boy spread his legs.\n\n\"Wh-What are you doing?\"",True)

You yank his testicles until his scrotum stretches to his rump, the orbs nestling below it like another pair of cheeks. Then, to ensure they don't snap back, you pull the erection through his thighs as well, locking it up against his crotch as you push his legs back together. The tautness in the skirt shifts with the manuever, making him appear far girlier from the front as the skirt lays flat against his dainty figure. Of course, his backside looks far more masculine with the thick sausage wedged against his thighs down past his knees with the orbs looking like a second rump beneath the skirt, but that's fine. You're able to conceal it mostly by stepping up behind him, at which point you begin to push him out of his tent.\n\n\"Wait! No! Don't!\" His cries go unheeded and immediately stop as he is pushed outside.\n\nThe boy stands there silently, trying not to draw any attention. His thighs clench around his genitals, desparately trying to prevent them from popping out. After several moments, he begins to realize that nobody is giving him a second thought as they pass by. With his monster tucked behind him, nobody is the wiser. They simply regard him as some flat-chested girl, not particularly ugly or pretty, maybe even a little cute...\n\nAs you feel him relax in front of you, you resume pushing him from behind. A little awkward and resistant at first, he stumbles while trying to keep things hidden. Quickly enough, however, he starts to learn how to walk with his thighs shut, giving him a rather exaggerated feminine swing to his hips. He even begins to break away from your pushing, taking the lead in having a nice stroll around the town. You remain close, of course, to ensure nobody sees the throbbing thing that pokes out behind him, especially as it seems to grow stiffer, the veins bulging from the slightly restricted bloodflow from his clamped thighs. It gets even more difficult to cover him as gobs of pre begin to leak out from the tip, spilling over your {self.legDesc(10)} and making the ground mildly slick.\n\nThe boy is obviously becoming more and more aroused, the reddening cock beginning to buck with his pulse from becoming so sensitive. His thighs squeeze the base of the shaft more, his hips gently thrusting to pull the rod through the tight space between his legs. With each step, he practically humps his own legs, pre dribbling from the tip in large wads while he sighs and moans. His pace slows the further he goes, his tail twitching and tickling the underside of the monster, his whole body jerking as it tries to maintain its composure. Just as he's about to stop, unable to press on any further, you step out and push him, immediately turning his back up against the canvas wall of the nearest tent.\n\nYou watch as his eyes flutter up into his head, a meek moan echoing out of his mouth. The lewd sound of wet splattering is quite audible and you take caution to cover it up from the public. Thick jet after thick jet of pearly warm whiteness launches from behind his legs, smattering the canvas as well as the back of his legs and over his ankles. The cock is oh so red from the built up blood within, so stiff and veiny that it's almost difficult to tell which bulge the hot spunk is pulsing out from. If you weren't actively keeping his legs closed as you stand before him, that thing would have likely broken through and spewed all over some unsuspecting citizens. Even as it is, the thing takes nearly a full minute to finish unloading its seed, the testicles bouncing against his ass as they throb while the rod bobs on its own accord. For an ejaculation without touching the most sensitive locations, it sure does have a good deal of pressure to it.",True)

Despite having climaxed so much, his cock remains stiff, unwilling to settle down after such an ordeal. It continues to ooze spunk down the back of his legs as you hurriedly push him away from the tent, leaving behind a rather large puddle before anybody can notice it while you're around. The boy is still in a mental haze, coming down from the numbing orgasm, and doesn't take too much care to hold onto his cock anymore. As you push him home, his legs don't hold as tightly and the thing between them begins to slip through. If it weren't for its large girth, it would have probably done so in a single step, but instead can only wedge through little by little. It's not until you reach his home does it finally spring free, catching the attention of a random bystander. Fortunately, they're far too confused to process what they just saw before you disappear inside, keeping the boy's secret safe.\n\nUsing some of the towels around his room, you help clean up legs and wipe off the drooling cock. It eventually slips back into his sheath beneath the skirt as he regains his composure.\n\n\"That... That... That was...\" The blushing deepens in his face as his mind begins to process all that just happened. He sits down on his bed, wincing in pain before spreading his legs and pulling his balls to the front. He rubs himself through the skirt while trying to keep the skirt as tidy as possible, seemingly enjoying it. \"I think I liked that more than I should...\" He utters in an honest but sheepish tone.\n\nYou immediately give him a hug, letting him know that there was nothing wrong in enjoying it. That's why you wanted him to do it, after all.\n\nIt takes a moment, but he returns the embrace. \"Thank you. That didn't really help my issues, but... I think I can appreciate certain... 'aspects' about it. I can't say that I won't be looking forward to doing something like that again...\" He trails off, but then breaks from the embrace in surprise. \"Oh my! After all that I have never even introduced myself! M-My name is Jamie. Kinda ironic, I guess, since that's also a girl's name, but I do kinda feel good looking like this.\" Again, he blushes in embarassment, but this time he's wearing a warm smile with it.\n\n\"Umm... \" He tugs at his skirt, trying to get it to hold taut over the hills of his testicles so the fabric can't lay against his sheath, where a blotch is starting to form. \"I should really get to cleaning up before I ruin the outfit. It took me so long last time... I'll be keeping an eye out for you in town though. I do hope to... enjoy more time with you.\"\n\nYou return his smile and give him a nod.

I mean, you're the only one who has actually taken any interest, so... if you're interested in that, I guess I am too!\"\n\nDucking between some tents so you have a little more privacy. You pop the pill into his mouth while he is caught slack jawed and off guard, forcing him to swallow before he's aware of what happened. He blinks for a moment, beginning to blush as a warmth flows through his body. When that warmth reaches his loins, the whole length of thick meat bucking in return and sending him sprawling back into the tent wall behind him. He braces himself against the canvas, his eyes closing and his teeth clenching while things begin to shift and swell.\n\nThe thing snaps the button of his shorts, making the lad's shirt flutter with the growing girth caught inside. The outline of his bulge becomes more visible, making the pulsing veins more apparent as they stand stiffly. They slowly reacher higher and higher, the large rod inside crawling up his belly and chest, the flaring head dragging across the inside of the fabric. He shivers from the sensation before grunting as the glans catches on the collar of his shirt. The meat bends slightly outward at the middle, unable to pass the simple barrier from the swelling alone. His muscles reflexively jerk at the base, making the whole thing wriggle and buck some more. Eventually, the monster manages to jiggle out, the tip springing up from the collar and launching a gob of pre from the sensitized head to his cheek.\n\nWhile the shaft above continues to rise, the orbs below also groan with growth. You can see them shift about, easily holding up his shorts from the tension, even with the broken button. The garment soon becomes strained with small creaking sounds around the thighs. The stallion looks rather distraught, twisting his hips around with an \"Nnngh\" as the testicles begin to squeeze themselves within the confines. His clothes were beginning to produce an unpleasant pressure with his pent-up arousal.\n\nBefore things could 'grow' more dire, you take it upon yourself to assist him with a hands-on approach. Specifically, your hands reach out for the throbbing flared equine cockhead that currently brushes against the boy's cheek as it rises. Your fingertips knead into the soft and plush yet rigid and rough glans, the blood beneath pressing back at your touch with great intensity. The massaging of your fingers over the tender expanding flesh makes the boy shiver with a snort.\n\nLarge wads of gooey cum leap heavily from the hole between your fingers, splattering up the side of his face and ear. They don't fly much further, too thick and weighty. And with the widening barrel of the loaded cannon, the rest of the spunk gurgles out from the tip like a slowly erupting volcano, the molten stuff surging over your hands and back down its length. However, what the ejaculation lacked in velocity it made up for with quantity...\n\nThe stuff doesn't stop gurgling from the tip as the tower continues its growth. The relief to his testicles barely keeps up with their swelling size, preventing any more discomfort, but in turn leaving him constantly moaning and softly neighing with gob after gob of sticky spooge drooling out of his erection. Your hands rapidly become soaked with a warm blanket of white, his shirt becoming shiny and heavy with pearlescant moisture.

His hands grope around himself, feeling how heavier and swollen he has become. \"Geeze... If I looked awkward before, now I must really be a freak...\" He looks up at your smiling face. \"But... You enjoy it like this? I... I guess as long as one person does, it's alright. Plus I must be close to being the 'manliest' man in Firmshaft with a package like this...\" He hefts up the scrotum and puffy sheath, letting them fall back down into his lap with a slight wince from the greater weight and a splash from the puddle below.\n\nWith a grimace, he begins to stand. White sheets of thick cum flow down from his body, making an even bigger mess around his feet. He wobbles a bit as he acclimates to his new size, feeling a little hunched as his balls hang down to his knees. \"Eww... We should probably get out of here before anybody sees the mess that...

The round sheath is exposed first, thick with much fleshy padding and a little bit of skin showing in the center as something holds itself back. Then the tops of the large orbs are exposed, so smooth and soft compared to the rest of his fur-covered body. He has to take special care to cradle them up out of his shorts with a palm so he can finish pulling the clothing down without tugging on himself. Once emptied, the shorts quickly fall down to his ankles, allowing him to spread his knees and let the things hang. And gosh do they hang...

It even feels lighter!\" He deliberately thrusts his hips, allowing the bits to bounce and swing about before your face. \"Hey, I think these can even fit now!\" Rapidly, he yanks up his shorts and tucks his testicles inside, both things easily fitting in and hardly showing through the fabric, and he bends the half-stiff erection off to the side. Pulling up the waist band over the girth, he can barely squeeze in most of the shaft. Yet, the flaring head refuses to hide, blatantly poking out over the side by his hip. \"Well, almost. But I'm sure it will be much easier to manage now, thank you!\" He lunges forward and embraces you in a grateful hug. Though, in the process of doing so, the button of his shorts comes undone and the package leaps free, giving you a good hearty thump to the chest.\n\nOnce he notices the sensation of his 'little' man being pressed up between your bodies, he hastily parts and apologizes again. \"Oops, so sorry about that...\" He averts his eyes in embarassment, but also begins to think as he looks around, his fingers balling up the sheets around his hands in ontemplation and hesitation. \"Umm... I... I really appreciate the care you've given me, helping me out and all. I don't want to seem to forward, but... I'll try to keep more of an eye out for you when you're here in Firmshaft... I'd like to do more with you!\" A big grin fills his face.\n\nA loud plop fills the air as a large gob of air-cooled cum drops down upon his head, turning his grin into a grimace. He looks up in time to get another wad in the face just as he notices the splatter upon his ceiling. Slowly wiping it away, he utters a long \"Ewwww...\"\n\n\"It looks like I've got some cleaning up to do... Thanks again for all your help, but I think I can handle this myself. To be honest, it's not really the first time I've had to clean off the ceiling... Oh! I totally forgot! My name is Jamie, nice to meet you!\"\n\nJamie thrusts out a hand to shake in a more official greeting. You take his hand with a chuckle and shake it back, only to be interupted by another splatter across your hands. He rolls his eyes and insists that you head out before you get any messier. You agree and wipe off some more of the cum before heading out the tent. And out of the corner of your eye as you leave, you notice him jiggling his package around in your absence, enjoying his new size, before another gob splashes down and makes him get to work...",True)

He looks into your eyes to see if you were just joking, but you don't give him any such sign. So, slowly, he concedes. \"You... You would actually like that? I-I suppose I could put it on again. Just... Don't laugh, okay?\"\n\nYou give him an eager nod, backing off to give him some room and letting his erection flop down between his knees. He stands from his bed before kneeling down to grope about beneath it, moving aside some towels until he grabs some other fabrics. The same tube top and skirt you first saw him wearing, he had been hiding it under his bed this whole time.\n\nWith his back to you, the boy finishes stripping by removing his shirt. It's quickly replaced by the tube top, his small frame fitting the small garment well. Then, his tail swishes a bit, giving you flashes of his tight rump, while he steps into the skirt and pulls it up. As it rises to his knees, he angles his member downward, catching it between his knees and behind the waistband of the garment, allowing the skirt to easily rise to his waist without obstruction. The rod pushes his testicles back between his thighs, forcing his legs to bend to give the package room until he can secure the girly thing at his waist. Once it's on, he's able to release the kraken, letting it flick forward with his thighs closing, pulling the hem of the skirt taut just above his knees. He shifts a bit in a crude attempt to make things better before presenting himself, but he eventually gives up and lets out a sigh. Eyes closed, he twirls around.\n\n\"There...\"\n\nThis time he didn't bother to wedge certain parts up into the tube top. Instead, the large cock reaches out at full stiffness, held down by the skirt. The skirt does have too much give though; with the bulbous testicles making the cloth tight around his thighs, the cock almost points straight down, hardly lifting the skirt at all. He didn't even bother with the panties this time, probably having learned his lesson, and didn't take care to prop his cock up into his tube top, which is good for what you're planning.\n\n\"Happy now?,\" he says with a disgruntled look on his face, even though his cock seems even stiffer now.\n\nYou smile in pleasure with no desire to laugh. You look him over, making sure to give him the feeling that you like what you see. You step behind him and begin to brush at his hair, combing it into a more stylish, girly appearance that matches the skirt. Then you duck down and make the confused boy spread his legs.\n\n\"Wh-What are you doing?\"",True)

You yank his testicles until his scrotum stretches to his rump, the orbs nestling below it like another pair of cheeks. Then, to ensure they don't snap back, you pull the erection through his thighs as well, locking it up against his crotch as you push his legs back together. The tautness in the skirt shifts with the manuever, making him appear far girlier from the front as the skirt lays flat against his dainty figure. Of course, his backside looks far more masculine with the thick sausage wedged against his thighs down past his knees with the orbs looking like a second rump beneath the skirt, but that's fine. You're able to conceal it mostly by stepping up behind him, at which point you begin to push him out of his tent.\n\n\"Wait! No! Don't!\" His cries go unheeded and immediately stop as he is pushed outside.\n\nThe boy stands there silently, trying not to draw any attention. His thighs clench around his genitals, desparately trying to prevent them from popping out. After several moments, he begins to realize that nobody is giving him a second thought as they pass by. With his monster tucked behind him, nobody is the wiser. They simply regard him as some flat-chested girl, not particularly ugly or pretty, maybe even a little cute...\n\nAs you feel him relax in front of you, you resume pushing him from behind. A little awkward and resistant at first, he stumbles while trying to keep things hidden. Quickly enough, however, he starts to learn how to walk with his thighs shut, giving him a rather exaggerated feminine swing to his hips. He even begins to break away from your pushing, taking the lead in having a nice stroll around the town. You remain close, of course, to ensure nobody sees the throbbing thing that pokes out behind him, especially as it seems to grow stiffer, the veins bulging from the slightly restricted bloodflow from his clamped thighs. It gets even more difficult to cover him as gobs of pre begin to leak out from the tip, spilling over your {self.legDesc(10)} and making the ground mildly slick.\n\nThe boy is obviously becoming more and more aroused, the reddening cock beginning to buck with his pulse from becoming so sensitive. His thighs squeeze the base of the shaft more, his hips gently thrusting to pull the rod through the tight space between his legs. With each step, he practically humps his own legs, pre dribbling from the tip in large wads while he sighs and moans. His pace slows the further he goes, his tail twitching and tickling the underside of the monster, his whole body jerking as it tries to maintain its composure. Just as he's about to stop, unable to press on any further, you step out and push him, immediately turning his back up against the canvas wall of the nearest tent.\n\nYou watch as his eyes flutter up into his head, a meek moan echoing out of his mouth. The lewd sound of wet splattering is quite audible and you take caution to cover it up from the public. Thick jet after thick jet of pearly warm whiteness launches from behind his legs, smattering the canvas as well as the back of his legs and over his ankles. The cock is oh so red from the built up blood within, so stiff and veiny that it's almost difficult to tell which bulge the hot spunk is pulsing out from. If you weren't actively keeping his legs closed as you stand before him, that thing would have likely broken through and spewed all over some unsuspecting citizens. Even as it is, the thing takes nearly a full minute to finish unloading its seed, the testicles bouncing against his ass as they throb while the rod bobs on its own accord. For an ejaculation without touching the most sensitive locations, it sure does have a good deal of pressure to it.",True)

Despite having climaxed so much, his cock remains stiff, unwilling to settle down after such an ordeal. It continues to ooze spunk down the back of his legs as you hurriedly push him away from the tent, leaving behind a rather large puddle before anybody can notice it while you're around. The boy is still in a mental haze, coming down from the numbing orgasm, and doesn't take too much care to hold onto his cock anymore. As you push him home, his legs don't hold as tightly and the thing between them begins to slip through. If it weren't for its large girth, it would have probably done so in a single step, but instead can only wedge through little by little. It's not until you reach his home does it finally spring free, catching the attention of a random bystander. Fortunately, they're far too confused to process what they just saw before you disappear inside, keeping the boy's secret safe.\n\nUsing some of the towels around his room, you help clean up legs and wipe off the drooling cock. It eventually slips back into his sheath beneath the skirt as he regains his composure.\n\n\"That... That... That was...\" The blushing deepens in his face as his mind begins to process all that just happened. He sits down on his bed, wincing in pain before spreading his legs and pulling his balls to the front. He rubs himself through the skirt while trying to keep the skirt as tidy as possible, seemingly enjoying it. \"I think I liked that more than I should...\" He utters in an honest but sheepish tone.\n\nYou immediately give him a hug, letting him know that there was nothing wrong in enjoying it. That's why you wanted him to do it, after all.\n\nIt takes a moment, but he returns the embrace. \"Thank you. That didn't really help my issues, but... I think I can appreciate certain... 'aspects' about it. I can't say that I won't be looking forward to doing something like that again...\" He trails off, but then breaks from the embrace in surprise. \"Oh my! After all that I have never even introduced myself! M-My name is Jamie. Kinda ironic, I guess, since that's also a girl's name, but I do kinda feel good looking like this.\" Again, he blushes in embarassment, but this time he's wearing a warm smile with it.\n\n\"Umm... \" He tugs at his skirt, trying to get it to hold taut over the hills of his testicles so the fabric can't lay against his sheath, where a blotch is starting to form. \"I should really get to cleaning up before I ruin the outfit. It took me so long last time... I'll be keeping an eye out for you in town though. I do hope to... enjoy more time with you.\"\n\nYou return his smile and give him a nod.

I mean, you're the only one who has actually taken any interest, so... if you're interested in that, I guess I am too!\"\n\nYou motion for him to open wide and you pop the pill into his mouth. He blinks for a moment after he swallows, beginning to blush as a warmth flows through his body. When that warmth reaches his loins, the whole length of thick meat bucks in return and sending him sprawling backwards onto his bed. He braces himself upon his sheets, his eyes closing and his teeth clenching while things begin to shift and swell.\n\nThe pole upon your shoulder begins to rise, lifting itself from the expanding flesh. If it weren't so large, it could have stood straight up, but instead it bends in the middle, jerking in the air with the growth from each beat of his heart. Gobs of pre ooze lazily from the widening tip, drooling down over your head until you move back a bit for cover.\n\nWhile the shaft above continues to rise and swell, the orbs below also groan with growth. You can see them shift about, urging his legs to spread wider to give them some room. They tug at his crotch, pulling the scrotum down with their increasing weight. You hear an \"Nnngh\" as the tightness and heaviness of the scrotum becomes uncomfortable for the poor prone boy.\n\nBefore things could 'grow' more dire, you take it upon yourself to assist him with a hands-on approach. Specifically, your hands reach out for the throbbing flared equine cockhead that leans in your direction. Your fingertips knead into the soft and plush yet rigid and rough glans, the blood beneath pressing back at your touch with great intensity. You stand to lift the pillar of meat up, holding the tower up in the air so it's not depending on its own strength. The massaging of your fingers over the tender expanding flesh as you hug it makes the boy shiver with a snort.\n\nLarge wads of gooey cum leap heavily from the hole between your fingers, splattering up over your arm. They don't fly much further, too thick and weighty. And with the widening barrel of the loaded cannon, the rest of the spunk gurgles out from the tip like a slowly erupting volcano, the molten stuff surging over your hands and back down its length. However, what the ejaculation lacked in velocity it made up for with quantity...\n\nThe stuff doesn't stop gurgling from the tip as the tower continues its growth. The relief to his testicles barely keeps up with their swelling size, preventing any more discomfort, but in turn leaving him constantly moaning and softly neighing with gob after gob of sticky spooge drooling out of his erection.

His hands grope around himself, feeling how heavier and swollen he has become. \"Geeze... If I looked awkward before, now I must really be a freak...\" He looks up at your smiling face. \"But...

You can barely tell her belly has deflated back to its original shape before Lila's go limp and she collapses into her puddle with a splash. Claws still stuck in the wooden wall with dress pinned in between from holding it, the rest of her body is stripped nude in the fall and she winds up leaning into the wall, her face and upper breasts pressing against it while her spread thighs twitch limply in the slime, her sex still easily visible and gaping with a steady drool...",True)

Her wings fold inward, the three finger-like talons at the ends of them awkwardly roaming about her breasts and down to her groin, fondling herself sporadically. It seems her wings are her arms, being attached at her shoulders like a bird's.\n\nOnce she gets close enough, you can see more under her cloak. A fennec-like face matches the fuzzy ears above, which each seem to be larger than her head, and a hot blush seems to have washed across her cheeks that almost matches her auburn hair. Soft fur nearly covers her body, parted in front by the large belly-scales that plate across her chest and stomach, from her slightly elongated neck down to the tip of her tail. Supple draconic spikes peek out several inches along her spine, all the way down to the tip of her tail where they gently bend back and forth as her tail swishes from side to side anxiously. The clasp of her cloak manages to hide her otherwise naked breasts, a nice pair that matches her lithe frame, though with the way she fumbles to fondle herself she threatens to undo the clasp at any moment. Her lower bits are covered by a jeweled loin-cloth - a relatively scant outfit for the torrid desert weather - which seems to be... tenting as her other hand works at herself beneath.\n\nShe bends forward as her short muzzle follows the scent right up to you, immediately nuzzling against your body. The wing at her bosom stops playing with herself to hug around you, the fingers digging into your back tenderly as she tries to hold you close.\n\n\"You...

Her talons pick at your {self.clothesBottom()}, trying to burrow her way in for a more intimate connection, but her lack of mental coherence makes the effort futile.\n\nHowever, as her nuzzling brings her muzzle closer to your pack, she begins to sniff again. Her voice wavers much less as she speaks; not undone by the lust this time, \"M-Magic?\"\n\nShe firmly presses into you as her muzzle dives into your pack for an even bigger whiff. \"Y-Yes, something neat in there...\" The sudden distraction seems to have helped her mind gain focus, able to make her think more clearly despite the thing that throbs against you. She leans back to look you directly in the eyes. Fear fills her own eyes, her normally shy and meek demeanor commanding her to flee, but even deeper beyond that you can see a lonely longing inside. Her cheeks more flushed with embarrassment than arousal now, the situation already quite shameful and far out of her usual comfort zone, especially in such a public place, she takes a deep breath and ventures a chance.\n\n\"Would...

A simple tunnel burrowing into the ground beneath the rock, the entrance is decorated with all sorts of crystalline chimes that softly ring out with a slight breeze. There's also some painted barriers to keep the sand out as well as a large barrel of water and towels to allow somebody to remove any sand from themselves as well. Otherwise, you can't quite tell what's in the tunnel.\n\n\"Well, umm... This is my home!\"",True)

Slipping her bikini back over her exposed nethers, she slowly stands, getting used to the sensation.\n\nThough her belly looks a bit bloated and gradually growing with the buildup, she seems grateful. \"Umm... thanks for that.\" She squirms slightly as her stiff clit presses visibly against the bikini's crotch, becoming more aroused from the swelling sensation. Absent-mindendly, she leans down and gives you a quick kiss, dropping one of her pre-laid eggs into your lap as a gift, before blushing ferociously and running off to find her fiancee."

She gasps and moans exuberantly, relying on your body for support as she completely lays back into you, the next egg soon passing through with a greater moan escaping her lips.\n\nAt least half an hour of this pleasurable oviposition passes in your arms.

However, the squatting position requires too much strength and she collapses forward onto her hands and knees, her rump pointing at the bushes. You can hear more eggs splash into the water behind her as she groans, her eyes clenching shut and her mouth wide with ecstasy.\n\nThe engaged girl's tail whips about behind her while her hips twitch and twist. She tries to reach down to fondle herself, but without the support she merely crashes into the water. In a wavering voice, she begs of you, \"Please... H-Help me!\"\n\nNot wanting to torture her, you move behind to see what you can do. In her shifting, it seems her bikini bottom had drooped back over her slit, only to be destroyed by the next egg on its forceful way out, the fabric torn away with only the outlining bands left intact. Essentially, her pussy is on blatant display as the bands slip behind her outer labia, leaving a gaping cunt that stretches even wider with each ovoid object it expels.\n\nUnsure what to do, you spot a large button that quivers with arousal. Sticking out from her lips and looking closer to a small penis, her clitoris is extremely engorged from the stimulation of her passage. So, you wrap your fingers around it and quickly proceed to jerk it with the plentiful lubrication that dribbles down from above. The girl cries out across the waters, turning some heads in the distance, as she instantly comes to her first orgasm, her whole body quaking. Again and again, with your efforts on her clit and the procession of eggs, the girl trembles and climaxes, her tail curling in the oddest of shapes in the air.\n\nAfter over half an hour of the extreme masturbation, the last egg pops out and the girl collapses onto the pile, crushing them all. She exhales under the water, bubbles floating to the surface before popping up for air. She continues to huff, letting the refreshing water regain some of her consciousness and eventually turns back to you.\n\n\"Wow... I-I didn't know one more eggcelerator could make me do that...\" She gasps again, completely oblivious to the fact that you're still staring into her gaping lewd genitals that she had attempted to hide earlier. \"H-Here, take these.

I just hope he can last a few days...\"\n\nShe reaches into another pile of her belongings she had left amongst the cattails and hands you a couple more doses of eggcelerator, as well as some coins for more compensation. Then she stands. Then she falls back into the water with a splash as her legs give out. Then she stands again and begins to awkwardly walk out of the water and straight to the bazaar. She also seems completely unaware of the missing fabric in bikini bottom, especially as her little 'erection' points the way..."

As she follows her nose towards its source, she sways back and forth a little, her hips twisting around as her thighs begin to rub together. She has to land on her sandle-protected paws as her wings fold inward, three finger-like talons at the ends of them awkwardly roaming about her breasts and down to her groin, functioning as hands. It seems her wings are her arms, being attached at her shoulders like a bird's.\n\nOnce she gets close enough, you can see more under her cloak. A fennec-like face matches the fuzzy ears above, which each seem to be larger than her head, and a hot blush seems to have washed across her cheeks that almost matches her auburn hair. Soft fur nearly covers her body, parted in front by the large belly-scales that plate across her chest and stomach, from her slightly elongated neck down to the tip of her tail. Supple draconic spikes peek out several inches along her spine, all the way down to the tip of her tail where they gently bend back and forth as her tail swishes from side to side anxiously. The clasp of her cloak manages to hide her otherwise naked breasts, a nice pair that matches her lithe frame, though with the way she fumbles to fondle herself she threatens to undo the clasp at any moment. Her lower bits are covered by a jeweled loin-cloth - a relatively scant outfit for the torrid weather - which seems to be... tenting as her other hand works at herself beneath.\n\nJust over 7 feet in height, she bends forward as her short muzzle follows the scent right up to you, immediately nuzzling against your body. The wing at her bosom stops playing with herself to hug around you, the fingers digging into your back tenderly as she tries to hold you close.\n\n\"You... You smell sooo good~\" A long tongue reaches out to lick up your chest, the pheromone that exudes from you enrapturing her keen senses while her tail wraps around your {self.legDesc(2)}. \"I don't even think I've ever...\"\n\nHer sentence simply trails off as her hips push into you, a phallic object peaking in her loin cloth and running up your side, pre smearing along its path. You can feel a feminine attribute press against your thigh as she slowly begins to gyrate on it, her other wing also encompassing you to surround you with her vibrant feathers. She gasps again and again as she tries to speak, but her words are lost to the smothering lust. Her talons pick at your {self.clothesBottom()}, trying to burrow her way in for a more intimate connection, but her lack of mental coherence makes the effort futile.\n\nHowever, as her nuzzling brings her muzzle closer to your pack, she begins to sniff again. Her voice wavers much less as she speaks; not undone by the lust this time, \"M-Magic?\"\n\nShe firmly presses into you as her muzzle dives into your pack for an even bigger whiff. \"Y-Yes, something neat in there...\" The sudden distraction seems to have helped her mind gain focus, able to make her think more clearly despite the thing that throbs against you. She leans back to look you directly in the eyes. Fear fills her own eyes, her normally shy and meek demeanor commanding her to flee, but even deeper beyond that you can see a lonely longing inside. Her cheeks more flushed with embarrassment than arousal now, the situation already quite shameful and far out of her usual comfort zone, she takes a deep breath and ventures a chance.\n\n\"Would...

And since her winged arms will be occupied with flying, her legs wind up cradling your back as she begins to take off, positioning you much lower down her body. You get a mighty whiff of arousal as pre drools over your lips, your face mashed up against the tip of the large erection in her loin cloth... Nevertheless, she avoids humping you too much as she focuses on remaining balanced in flight, giving you a chance to twist around and watch the sand fly by below. The two of you go higher and higher, giving you a fantastic view of the desert. You spot Oviasis in the distance and can clearly see the path to your destination: a large dune about 2 hours away on foot. You wouldn't have given much attention such a dune in your usual exploration, since it looks like many many many of the others, but as you fly over to the opposite side you can make out a large jutting stone overhanging a cave.\n\nThe strange woman takes you down and lands you gently atop the sand, giving you a good view of the outside of 'her place'. A simple tunnel burrowing into the ground beneath the rock, the entrance is decorated with all sorts of crystalline chimes that softly ring out with a slight breeze. There's also some painted barriers to keep the sand out as well as a large barrel of water and towels to allow somebody to remove any sand from themselves as well.

Bottles and bottles of fresh milk waiting to be delivered surround your path. The farmer urges you forward, leading you deeper in until the crates become tools and parts. Equipment from around the farm is either dismantled or waiting to be repaired. And then there's a small workspace cleared out, filled with nothing but a large, clean machine. In front is a mechanical platform, laying several feet wide from the rest of the machine, with a thick railing surrounding it, perfect for tying cows up to as they stand on top.\n\n\"Well, this is it.\" The farmer proudly motions towards it. \"The Auto-Milker 5000! Why 5000? Eh, I thought it sounded nice. But this little doohickey should help save us plenty of work when milking the cows. Now, if you don't mind...\"\n\nHe directs you onto the platform, facing out towards the rail. A hand presses lightly on your back. \"Just need you to bend forward, you can lean over the rail. The cows don't quite walk on two legs, so you gotta press on the rail for the machine's safety protocols.\" He chuckles. You do as you're told, bending forward and leaning comfortably over the thick rail, crossing your arms to rest your head. Then you jerk a little as you feel him grope about your {self.clothesBottom()}. \"Cows don't quite wear clothes either, so we gotta get yer udder outta there.\"\n\nBefore you can protest, he pulls your {self.clothesBottom()} {self.pullUD(2)}, letting your {self.udderDesc()} udder hang freely.

And all around, the walls are covered with many, many pictures, with a particularly series centered and more prominent than the rest.\n\nSilandrias takes a deep breath and rests against a wall, making sure her womb has settled enough before speaking. \"This is where me and my sisters hatched...\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly why it's so deep and the tunnels around here look different, like they were made in a hurry, but I believe these pictures can somewhat tell why.\" She takes another deep breath and prepares to explain as much as she can, motioning across the images as she speaks. \"These pictures show that my people were once a much more common race. These tunnels were filled with many families, all living together, with even more tunnel networks like these scattered over what was once a rather lively savannah. Food was plentiful, people were happy, and life was good. However, they saw... something coming.\"\n\nShe focuses on a picture that resembles a wave washing over the land, although the wave itself seems distorted, confused, not clear at all. \"I don't think they knew exactly what it was, but they knew that it would mean the end of our people. Maybe some kind of destructive force? It would explain the many magical items I find strewn throughout the dunes, but even then they are largely intact, not damaged in ways you would expect if that were the case... But anyways, they knew it was coming and in fear of losing us all, they made this room to hide some of their eggs in hopes of making at least some of us survive. And, well, they did.\"\n\n\"Yet, on the other hand, it seems like me and my sisters were the only ones that did survive. I'm sure our parents knew it would happen too, which is why they made all of these pictures. They wouldn't be able to teach us their language, but they could at least teach us some of our history with these images. They taught us how to navigate the tunnels, how to find food, how to live, how to fly. They couldn't teach us everything though, and if it weren't for our caretaker, who we named Saeru - a creature who couldn't speak but could understand us and did her best to take care of us - we probably wouldn't have survived to this day. But even she couldn't help us - me learn how certain things work. None of us ever tried to get... well, like now...\""

We never knew where she came from, but we saw her like a mother and she was one of the first to leave, with two of my sisters who ventured out to find others like us.\"\n\n\"Then there were two other sisters who went exploring and found Oviasis. The lizan people were afraid at first, but since we were still so young and innocent it didn't take long before they were teaching us their language and trading supplies with us. Soon three of my sisters were staying in Oviasis nearly all the time, building their own lives there and falling in love. However, the waters there slowly changed them, making them more and more like the lizan people, until eventually you couldn't even tell they were like us.

They still had their wings at least, so they could travel, but they were afraid they might lose them soon as well. But oh, the wonders they said they saw. So many other kinds of people and places, things that they could study and experience. Kinda like my fascination with magical items, except more outgoing. There was so much out there that they couldn't stay here for long. And my other two sisters loved them tremendously and couldn't let them go by themselves. I told them that it was alright, that I still had our sisters in Oviasis to keep me company, that the five of them could head off on their adventures together. They were hesitant, but I wouldn't let them choose otherwise. I even still get letters from them every now and then, somehow sent to Oviasis from some elaborate route, keeping us apprised of their ventures and the different ways they've changed.\"\n\n\"It's quite odd, really.

Nearly as large as herself, it looks like the minotaur you defeated in the previous room, except small and adorable. The thing seems to have seen a fair deal of use, however, as it's completely covered in patches of leather. You can't really tell how old it is, considering much of the leather looks brand new whereas other places look quite worn and faded, with quite a few gashes from some kind of scratches that should probably be patched up as well soon. Nevertheless, the girl hugs it close as she begins to skip around in a circle, her skirt bouncing with small glimpses of her undies as she frolics. \"We're gonna pla-ay~ We're gonna pla-ay~ We're gonna pla-ay~\"\n\nShe seems just so adorable that you almost feel obligated to play. That is... until she stops dead in her tracks and turns to you with a ferocious stare, her eyes looking far darker and her pigtails looking almost like wings as the hair curls outward sinisterly.

Garters descend down to help hold up her thigh-high high-heeled boots from a belt that lazily hangs around her waist, adorned with glowing vials and a long beatiful whip. To top the whole image off, her milky white skin, long black hair, short little horns, short bat-like wings, and eyes as red as her outfit, all amount to a single idea. A succubus.

These options are organised in a ttk notebook widget to make it easier to list them. Their functions are described below:\n\n<u>Options Tab</u>\nThis tab contains the basic configuration that the average person might want to touch.\n\n<b>Sol Mode</b>\nForces the game to use the original save file formats instead of xml. The game can still load sol file without this options, xml files are just the priority. This does not do anything if \"Use Expanded Save Dialog\" is active.\n\n<b>Fixed Resolution</b>\n(Not implemented yet) Forces the game's main window to be at a specific resolution and prevents its subwindows from resizing.\n\n<b>Custom Theme Color</b>\nAllows you to set a custom theme color. In the original game, this could only be done by editing the nimin_prefs.sol file.\n\n<b>Custom Font Color</b>\nAllows you to set a custom font color. In the original game, this could only be done by editing the nimin_prefs.sol file.\n\n<b>Save Location</b>\nAllows you to set a custom default save file location. If the chosen location does not exist, it will be created for you.\n\n<u>Game Tweaks Tab</u>\nThis tab contains any tweak that modifies gameplay and other elements of the game that aren't strictly visual.\n\n<b>Grammar Tweaks</b>\nChanges specific words in the game to be less derogetory or more correct. Also toggles specific changes I made to make the game more consistent or make more sense (sometimes the game wouldn't check if you actually had something before giving a description of it). Some examples are:\nFemmie -> Feminine\nFemme-boy -> Femboy\nShemale -> Futanari\n\n<b>Status Tweaks</b>\nCurrently does two things, 1) Changes the maximum strength stat to 200 just because I felt like it and 2) Makes the Femboy starting option slighly more feminine.\n\n<b>Succubus Leaves One</b>\nMakes the succubus leave one cock instead of taking all of them.\n\n<b>Use isBottomOpen</b>\nReplaces the various parts of the game that check for open bottom clothes with my function isBottomOpen. This is only in here because some of the spots where this is checked didn't include all of the \"open\" bottom clothes (I'm assuming that was by accident).\n\n<b>Lizan Don't Show Balls</b>\n(Most) Lizards don't come with (external) nuts, why should Lizan. This option hides your balls if you only have lizardCocks and does the same for npcs.\n\n<b>Use Expanded Save Dialog</b>\nReplaces the save/load dialog with one that can load any file from inside of the game's save directory.\n\n<b>Herm Can Has Both</b>\n(Not implemented yet) Makes herms able to experience both male and female senarios where it makes sense.\n\n<b>Internal Balls Affect Belly Size</b>\n(Not implemented yet) When self.showBalls is False, makes self.ballSize affect belly size in the calculation the game does for weight and size.\n\n<b>Direct Path to Sanctuary</b>\nAdds an explore option that appears once you defeat the final boss in doOldCaveDescent that allows you to travel directly between Firmshaft and Sanctuary without having to go through the dungeon. The path must first be opened from Sanctuary before it can be used from Firmsaft.\n\n<b>Some races get digitgrade feet</b>\n(Implementation incomplete) Gives some races (feline, lupine, equine, bovine) digitgrade feet. Feline and lupine get digipaws, equine and bovine get hooves. The logic for digipaws was already implemented in the game but was only used for the skunk race.\n\n<u>Debug Tweaks Tab</u>\nThis tab only shows up when debug mode is active. The contained options are also only active when debug mode is active.\n\n<b>alwaysChooseSenario(debug mode only)</b>\nAllows you to choose whatever senario from your current area that you want when exploring. Requires user input in the terminal every time.\n\n<b>takeNoDamage</b>\nMakes enemies deal no damage. (currently only does anything in eDmg)"

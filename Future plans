- Put all funcitons back into a main class and remove all of the global statements (I'm already working on this and the game runs much faster without global statements)
- Fix detailedStats alignment
- Optimize _Desc, _Hair, _ID, _Name, _Value, _Description, enemy_, apoth_ functions
- Make shops return to doShops instead of doGeneral

- Remove warning message when I no longer need it
- Optimize doProstitute as it heavily uses outputMainText and is noticably slow
- Optimize _Desc, _Hair, _ID, _Name, _Value, _Description, enemy_, apoth_ functions
- Optimize things to use outputMainText less (due to the way that I had to implement it, it is very expensive)
- Optimize initial load time (probably not possible because tkinter is what is taking a long time)
- Fix detailedStats alignment
- Work on wiki
    - Finish menus and wiki pages
    - Add support for enter navigation
    - Fix menu loading times (might not be possible)

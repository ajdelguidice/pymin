//WARNING: PORN// (Unofficial) Python port of Nimin Fetish Fantasy. I was bored so I made it. This port is for preservation as well as bug fixes and quality of life improvements over the origional, I will not be developing the game content any further. Game mostly works but still has a couple issues. No dynamic resizing yet. This will not run well on very slow systems (I tried). If you get stuck somewhere or there are no buttons and there is no error message in the console, I likely forgot to add one line in that senario. Please report it to me with where you found it (location and the text being diplayed in the main text area)<br><br>As of version 1.0.7, requires Python>=3.10<br><br>For those using a distribution's version of python or python packages, if this program doesn't work try using a virtual environment (python -m venv). <br><br>Requires:<br>math (Built-in),<br>random (Built-in),<br>os (Built-in),<br>pathlib (Built-in),<br>xml (Built-in),<br>tkinter (Built-in unless you are on a linux distribution that has it in a seperate package like Debian),<br>re (Built-in),<br>platform (Built-in),<br>sys (Built-in)<br>[miniamf](https://pypi.org/project/Mini-AMF/),<br>[tkhtmlview](https://pypi.org/project/tkhtmlview/),<br>[as3lib](https://pypi.org/project/as3lib/)

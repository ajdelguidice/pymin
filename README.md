<b><i>WARNING: PORN</i></b>
<br>(Unofficial) Python port of Nimin Fetish Fantasy. I was bored so I did this for fun. This port is for preservation as well as bug fixes and quality of life improvements over the original, I will not be developing the game content any further. Game mostly works but still has a couple issues. If you get stuck somewhere or there are no buttons and there is no error message in the console, I likely forgot to add one line in that senario. Please report it to me with where you found it (location and the text being diplayed in the main text area)<br><br>As of version 1.0.7, requires Python>=3.10<br><br>For those using a distribution's version of python or python packages, if this program doesn't work try using a virtual environment (python -m venv or by using the script I provided to set it up). <br><br>Requires:<br>math (Built-in),<br>random (Built-in),<br>os (Built-in),<br>pathlib (Built-in),<br>xml (Built-in),<br>tkinter (Built-in unless you are on a linux distribution that has it in a seperate package like Debian),<br>re (Built-in),<br>platform (Built-in),<br>sys (Built-in)<br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/Mini-AMF/">miniamf</a>,<br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/tkhtmlview/">tkhtmlview</a>,<br><a href="https://pypi.org/project/as3lib/">as3lib</a>

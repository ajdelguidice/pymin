<h2>(Unofficial) Python port of Nimin Fetish Fantasy</h2>
<h4><i>WARNING: PORN</i></h4>
| <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/view/12638483/">Original game</a> | <a href="https://github.com/ajdelguidice/nimin-source">Game source code</a> |
<br><br>As of version 1.0.7, requires Python>=3.10.
<br>Please read the first section of the <a href="https://github.com/ajdelguidice/python-as3lib/blob/main/README.md">readme for as3lib</a> as well before using.
<br><br>This port is for preservation as well as bug fixes and quality of life improvements over the original, I will not be developing the game content any further. The game runs much faster in a virtual environment.
<br><br>For those using a linux distribution's version of python or python packages, if this program doesn't work try using a virtual environment (python -m venv or by using the script I provided to set it up). You should be using a virtual environment anyways but I understand if you don't want to.
<br><br><b>Use the version of as3lib that is designated in the release notes of the version you are using.</b> The interface portion of as3lib is not backwards compatible between any version as it is still in alpha.
<br><br>If you get stuck somewhere or there are no buttons and no error message in the console, I likely forgot to add one line in that senario. Please report it to me with where you found it (in game location and the text being diplayed in the main text area).

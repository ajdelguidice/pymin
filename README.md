//WARNING: PORN// Python conversion of Nimin Fetish Fantasy. Heavily WIP (Most of the game works but anything to do with the choiceList functions like the bag and stash are only partially functional) I am not resposible for anything caused by exploitation of the xml parser.

Made with python3.8

Requires:
math (Built-in),
random (Built-in),
os (Built-in),
pathlib (Built-in),
xml (Built-in),
tkinter (Built-in unless you are on a linux distribution that has it in a seperate package like Debian),
[miniamf](https://pypi.org/project/Mini-AMF/)
